If your car gets damaged... “</p><p>However, the motorist becomes annoyed and repeatedly tells the workman “no”.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Motors">Read More on Motors</h2><p>He says: “I will tell you the <a href=#>law</a>. I don't fear nothing. I'll get all the documents.”</p><p>Mr Lockett says the “rude” man then left without moving his car, which forced the workmen to remove their long poles at an angle, meaning they temporarily blocked the road.</p><p>Footage then shows how the workmen deliberately trap the man’s car in by putting scaffolding poles around it.</p><p>Another clip shows the driver returning an hour later and one of Mr Lockett’s colleagues tells the man: “I’ve done the barrier.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>When he then asks “what are you doing?” Mr Lockett replies: “You asked us to put a barrier up, mate.”</p><p>The angry driver then slams his car door and says: “Okay, I don’t care, you can do anything you want to do.”</p><p>Mr Lockett claims that after filming had stopped, the driver said he was going to call the <a href=#>West Midlands</a> <a href=#>Police</a>, but they never appeared.</p><p>After around 10 minutes, the scaffolders removed the barrier blocking the man in and resumed their work.</p><p>While Mr Lockett said the stunt was “petty” he added they had “played him at his own game”.</p><p>He thinks the man should have used his “common sense” and moved his car to another spot so they could do their work safely.</p><p>The video has split <span id=25a983ee-b9a1-4780-a685-c54d1425bb9c class=suggested-link>opinion</span> online, including other industry professionals.</p><p>While some have congratulated Mr Lockett on getting his revenge others claim the car didn’t need to be moved anyway.</p><p>Mr Lockett says there was originally a barrier covering the parking bay though it's unclear where this was during the video clips or if someone had removed it.</p><p>The scaffolder, from <a href=#>Stoke-on-Trent</a>, <a href=#>Staffordshire</a>, said: “We agree that it's petty but he was being petty so we played him at his own game.</p><p>“There was a plastic barrier already there but by the time we came outside the chap had moved it out of the way and parked up.</p><p>“We were having to get 21ft poles out of an 8ft gap so it's not really practical and there's more risk to the car and the public.</p><p>“It's about common sense as well. Why would you want to risk your property getting damaged?</p><p>“Before I videoed him I asked him to move but he refused to. I videoed him to cover my own back.</p><p>“He got quite irate and was point-blank refusing to move it and claiming he knew laws off the top of his head.</p><p>“We showed him decency by speaking to him in a polite way, but I suppose some people haven't been raised with manners.</p><p>“I understand his frustration but there were numerous parking spaces he could have used. He took issue with us for no reason.</p><p>“When you're at work you've just got to bite your tongue and be polite with them.</p><p>“Instead of getting angry about it we thought we'd get some revenge this way.</p><p>“He told us we should have barriered the whole parking space off so that our barrier couldn't be moved, so we barriered him in with scaffolding instead.</p><p>“He wanted to try and ruin our day so me and the rest of the lads all had a giggle at him.</p><p>“Working people have got to do their job and pay their <a href=#>bills</a> so you've got to let them get on with it.”</p><p>Mr Lockett claims he and his truck were at the property all day and didn't face any more issues.</p><p>His videos posted on <a href=#>Facebook</a> have picked up more than 300 likes and 70 comments.</p><p>One said: “Scaffs take no s**t. Well done lads.”</p><p>Another wrote: “Fair play boys quality that.”</p><p>While a third added: “What a plonker. Just move your bloody car.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>However, one said: “B***ends!
