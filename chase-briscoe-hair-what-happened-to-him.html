Additionally, Briscoe made headlines for a recent accident he was involved in.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Chase Briscoe is a talented American racing driver who comes from a long line of racers in his family. He was born on December 15, 1994, in Mitchell, Indiana.</p><p>Chase started his racing career on dirt tracks in and around his home state. He grew up watching his grandfather and father race, and it wasn’t long before he caught the racing bug himself.</p><p>Briscoe began racing at a young age and won the championship in the ARCA Racing Series in 2016 and finished second in 2017.</p><p>In 2018, he debuted in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, earning two wins and finishing fifth in the championship standings as a rookie. He continued to impress in the series, earning a total of nine wins and 13 pole positions over three seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/274383940_464055815448901_8475561907035835337_n-e1681716285805.jpg><p>In 2021, he moved up to the NASCAR Cup Series and had a strong rookie season.</p><p>Likewise, in 2022, Chase won his first Cup Series race at Phoenix Raceway and became the 200th Cup Series champion in NASCAR history in only his second full-time season in the series.</p><p>Furthermore, he is also the owner of Chase Briscoe Racing, a World of Outlaws sprint car racing team that he founded in 2018. The team competes in races across the country, with Briscoe occasionally joining in behind the wheel.</p><p><span>Chase Briscoe Hair&nbsp;</span></p><p>NASCAR driver Briscoe has also become the subject of much attention due to his receding hairline.</p><p>The once-full head of hair is now thinning, which is common for many athletes who wear helmets for extended periods of time. Briscoe, however, has not let his hair loss get him down and has even taken to social media to share some humor about his situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/184407920_320949342890141_5609166086167998161_n-e1681715509210.jpg><p>Briscoe’s hair loss is not uncommon among NASCAR drivers, who often wear helmets for long periods of time. The constant friction and pressure on the scalp can cause hair loss, and some drivers have even reported developing bald spots.</p><p>Despite the hair loss, Chase continues to be a successful driver and is not letting his appearance affect his performance on the track. He remains a fan favorite and continues to entertain his followers on social media with his humor and candidness.</p><h2>What Happened To <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":" Chase Briscoe Hair"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":513,"3":{"1":0},"12":0}'>Chase Briscoe?</span></h2><p>Professional racing can be a dangerous sport, and there is always a certain level of risk involved for the drivers.</p><p>The speeds at which NASCAR cars travel, combined with the close proximity of the other cars on the track, can lead to high-speed accidents that can result in serious injuries or even fatalities.</p><p>However, even after accidents, <a href=# rel=noopener>NASCAR racers</a> try to come back to the track to continue wowing their fans.</p><p>Chase Briscoe, who had a very deadly accident just 7 months before, returned to the track as soon as he got ready.
