It's also twenty times what I paid to park - albeit in the wrong car.</p><h2>'I FEEL IT'S WRONG'</h2><p>"I could just pay the fine to Premier Parking Solutions of Newton Abbot and keep quiet, but I feel it's wrong.</p><p>"You would think that an operator of parking controls would accept that as just a silly mistake, right? I am asking them to be sensible and reasonable."</p><p>Scott has now contacted the Independent Appeals Service (IAS) and believes the fine goes against the guidance given by the secretary of state for transport which says: "An authority has a discretionary power to cancel a PCN at any point throughout the process.</p><p>"It can do this even when an undoubted contravention has occurred if the authority deems it to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.</p><p>"Under general principles of public law, authorities have a duty to act fairly and proportionately and are encouraged to exercise discretion sensibly and reasonably and with due regard to the public interest."</p><p>A spokesperson for Premier Parking Solutions said: "Whilst we can’t comment on individual cases that are with the independent adjudicator, the error appears solely to be with the motorist who has authorised the incorrect vehicle to park.</p><p>"It is not at all controversial to ask that the correct vehicle is authorised properly to park and by making the mistake the motorist has caused us to incur losses accordingly."</p><h2>'THE DRIVER IS RESPONSIBLE'</h2><p>A spokesperson for RingGo said in a statement: "When paying for parking via any mobile app, the driver is responsible for ensuring their vehicle registration number is entered correctly.</p><p>"We know mistakes happen, so RingGo does offer a grace period for drivers to correct their registration data after they’ve paid to park if they need to.</p><p>"If the wrong details are entered and the driver doesn’t correct them, they are liable to receive a parking penalty charge notice (PCN).</p><p>"If this happens, PCNs will only ever be issued by the parking operator – in this case, the Local Authority’s civil parking enforcement team. A cashless parking payment provider like RingGo will never issue drivers a PCN.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"Drivers can reach out to the parking operator to explain the mistake and ask for the fine to be reconsidered – the relevant contact details are always listed on the parking charge notice.</p><p>"Because RingGo do not issue PCNs, we can’t support with the appeals process – this needs to be resolved between the driver and the operator."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695674088.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Moment traffic warden is caught parked on double yellow lines as furious driver accuses her of running away</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxygpdrbmptYWS9or7KoqWgZZaeu6Z5w5qbZqiRnrFuvsinnqCnXaW5urnOrquhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
