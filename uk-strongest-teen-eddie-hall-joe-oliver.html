My main attribute in rugby was physical power. Most of my family is quite strong.</p><p>"I went in with the goal of hitting the podium [at the U23s].</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN SPORT">READ MORE IN SPORT</h2><p>"It's quite a big standard and a lot of the guys who have won it in the past have gone on to achieve quite big things - the likes of <a href=#>Tom Stoltman</a> and Paul Smith.</p><p>"It can skyrocket your career and I ended up winning it, beating the reigning champion at the time which earned me a spot at UK's Strongest Man 2022.</p><p>"I managed to get through to day two which is the semi-finals, so I was the youngest competitor to reach the semi-finals."</p><p>Oliver, 20, also received a late call-up to England's Strongest Man where he finished sixth - with <a href=#>Paul Smith claiming top prize</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image6.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image5.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image2.jpeg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS</a></strong></p><p>Smith also took the top gong in the UK's Strongest Man 2022 and Oliver admitted it has been "surreal" competing with the 28-year-old.</p><p>Oliver knows he has to emulate the likes of Smith, <a href=#>Hall</a> and Great Britain's Strongest Man 2007 Terry Hollands if he is to write his name in the history books.</p><p>He added: "Doing a couple of competitions last year put me in the spotlight and all of a sudden people I've only seen on TV are following me on Instagram which is proper surreal really because you realise you're actually making a name for yourself in the sport when people like that are following you.</p><p>"[I was] doing the UK's and I was sat next to Paul Smith in the changing rooms, Terry Hollands comes in and sits next to me. It's quite surreal, especially as these are guys I can just message and talk to freely, it is quite weird, I can nearly call them a friend at this point.</p><p>"I'd always watched World's Strongest Man but you never really look at it and think 'oh I could do that'.</p><p>"Terry Hollands, Eddie Hall, you look at those guys and you think 'how can I be like them'."</p><p>For Oliver the journey to become the next Hall is made even harder due to his size.</p><p>At 6ft0 he is one of the smallest Strongmen in the field but weighing 142kg he is more than able to compete - though maintaining his power is a full-time job in itself.</p><p>He explained: "I eat 7-7,5000 calories a day. You might think 'oh I could do that' and you might be able to do it for one day, but when you have to do it every single day, consistently all the time it's hard.</p><p>"Every morning I have seven Weetabix and a lot of milk, along with six eggs.</p><p>"Then straight into a snack which is normally fruit and breakfast bars which are easy carbs.</p><p>"I have three portions of chicken and rice or chicken and pasta or potatoes.</p><p>"Before training the focus is carbs and potentially a bit of sugar, normally pancakes or bagels, something that is simple carbs - you can't think of diet like how a bodybuilder would think, because we don't have to look good.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"During training I'll have sugary things like Haribo or a flapjack. Then come home and it's back to the meat and carbs, I'll normally have something a bit different like fish, meatballs or burgers.</p><p>"I finish off the day with a protein shake and peanut butter on toast. Every now and then I have a bit of cheesecake too."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9ygpFsbXJpX6q4br%2FTq6ann5WowW7AxJ6lZp2Umbameceao6VlmqSybrvLoq2eql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
