Sometimes you don’t like when I cry out to you, but it is very hard to want to be alive right now.”</p><p>When Josh responded, “If you feel like you’re depressed, you can try talking to someone, she replied, “Something has got to happen because something bad is going to happen.”</p><p>He then shockingly said before storming out of the room: "You saying that you’re going to kill yourself? I’m not going to be a part of that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000581200401.png><p>Mackenzie then cried to a producer: “This is the support I have from him. I’m not going to do anything to myself cause I love my kids so much, but I hate being alive.</p><p>"It’s so painful. I’ve tried to have this conversation with him every single day and he just walks away from me.”</p><p>When Mackenzie called him to tell him how much he hurt her by walking away, he responded that her contemplating suicide made him “mad,” as they have three kids, Gannon, Jaxie and Broncs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000576699716.jpg><p>When he returned home, she said: “I wasn’t saying I’m going to kill myself cause I’m not going to do that to my kids. I did not think her death was going to be half this hard.”</p><p>But when Josh ignored her and walked away again, she cried and screamed: “You hate me! Just be here for me. I feel like I’m so desperate for you to love me, but you don’t.”</p><p>He responded: “I don’t know what else to do, you know how I feel. I love you.”</p><p>Angie lost her battle to cancer in December at age 50.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000581200137.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000581200360.png><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in entertainment</h2></p><p>But the death hasn’t been Mackenzie’s only hurdle, as she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">split from Josh in August</a> after he admitted to cheating rumors while out of town for a rodeo gig.</p><p>After a marriage retreat, Josh set up a scavenger hunt and re-proposed with a new engagement ring.</p><p>Teen Mom OG airs Tuesdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text Crisis Text Line at 741741.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpYWqCeIKPbGatnZWjeq67zGakmpubmru7tcRmpJyjlZp6pLvNrZymqJyWwaa%2FjKysopuZmbJurcWtnKtlnaS6bq%2FAp5qeql2ZsqLAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
