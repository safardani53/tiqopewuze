itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>THE last photos taken of Travis Alexander, Jodi Arias’ boyfriend were of him naked in the shower.</strong></p><p>Arias is accused of shooting Alexander in the face, stabbing him 27 times and slitting his throat while in the shower.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601726200-1.jpg><p>Here is more on the gory murder.</p><h2>Who was Travis Alexander?</h2><p>Travis Alexander, 30, was a salesman and the boyfriend of amateur photographer, Jodi Arias.</p><p>The pair met at a PrePaid Legal Services conference in Las Vegas, <a href=#>Nevada</a> in September of 2006, while Alexander <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worked as a sales rep for the company</a>.</p><p>Arias and Alexander began dating in early 2007 and she moved from <a href=#>California</a> to Mesa, <a href=#>Arizona</a> to be closer to him.&nbsp;</p><p>She then relocated back to California to live with her grandparents, but continued a long distance relationship with Alexander.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601726197-1.jpg><p>Both would take turns visiting each other from state to state for nearly a year and a half.</p><p>The two eventually split up in 2007 but kept in contact.</p><p>Arias claimed she ended the relationship because she didn't trust Alexander, and she later alleged he was a sexual deviant who physically and sexually abused her.</p><h2>What happened to him?</h2><p>Alexander had asked Arias to join him on a work trip to <a href=#>Cancun</a> in June of 2008.</p><p>Shortly before the trip, Alexander changed his mind and decided he would take a female friend in the place of Arias.</p><p>On May 28, Arias’ grandparents home was burglarized - one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">items that was stolen was a .25-caliber automatic Colt pistol</a> which was never recovered.</p><p>Arias tried to get a hold of Alexander on June 2, but he did not answer.</p><p>The two eventually spoke for about 18 minutes on one phone call and on a second that lasted 41 minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/29e7bc3c-fbb2-4396-9711-b186855e704b.jpg><p>She set out in the wee hours of the morning to drive south to rent a car for a trip to <a href=#>Utah</a>.</p><p>That same day she rented a car at Budget Rent a Car in Redding, California and by June 3, she was driving to <a href=#>Salt Lake City</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander was supposed to be at a conference call on June 4 but missed it.&nbsp;</p><p>Arias went to business meetings all throughout - she had dyed her hair from blonde to brown and had various cuts on her hands, as her coworker <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Burns testified during her trial</a> in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000403055694-1.jpg><p>She drove back to Redding and returned the rental car.&nbsp;</p><p>The clerk noticed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">red stains in the seats</a> and missing floor mats but no verification could be made to tie Arias to the mats or stains.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Was Jodi Arias having an affair?</h3></p><ul><li>Several emails surfaced during trials of Arias exchanging sentiments with her co-worker, Ryan Burns.</li><li>Burns testified in court claiming that the two had an affair a day before she murdered Alexander.</li><li>Just like how she met Alexander, her and Burns met at a PrePaid Legal convention in 2008.</li><li>The two began speaking on the phone multiple times a week and made plans to hang out in Utah, where Burns lived.</li><li>Arias showed up to Burns' house with cuts on her hands and new hair dye after murdering Alexander.</li><li>According to Burns, they hooked up but did not have sex.</li><li>Arias confided in him and told him that she slept with Alexander despite her thinking she was being "cheated on."</li></ul><h2>What was the crime scene in Travis Alexander’s bathroom?</h2><p>On June 9, Alexander’s friends became concerned after not hearing from him and went over to his apartment to check on him.</p><p>His friends entered his bedroom and discovered large pools of blood in the hallway, only to later discover<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> his body in the shower</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601744838.jpg><p>Alexander was shot with a .25 caliber round with his throat slit and about 27 stab wounds all over his body.</p><p>His friends immediately dialed 9-1-1 and pointed out Arias as a suspect, citing that Alexander had mentioned she would stalk him, hack his Facebook and had previously slashed his tires.&nbsp;</p><p>Police recovered the last images of him when they searched his home and found a camera damaged in a washing machine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601753612.jpg><p>In it were sexually explicit photos of Arias and Alexander taken on June 4.&nbsp;</p><p>The last photo of him alive was in the shower taken that same day.</p><p>Moments after, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">photos show him bleeding on the bathroom floor</a> with blood gushing from his throat.</p><p>Police found DNA linking Arias to the crime scene.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601753603.jpg><h2>Is Jodi Arias still in prison for his murder?</h2><p>In July of 2008, Arias was indicted by a grand jury in Maricopa County, Arizona, for the first-degree murder of Alexander.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601744846.png><p>She was arrested at her home and extradited to <a href=#>Arizona</a> on September 5.</p><p>Arias told police different stories regarding her involvement in Alexander's death.</p><p>During the investigation she mentioned that she had not been in Mesa on the day of the murder and had last seen Alexander in March of 2008.</p><p>She then told police that two intruders had broken into Alexander's home, murdering him and attacking her.</p><p>She pled not guilty and insists that the murder occurred in “self-defense” claiming that she was a victim of domestic violence.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601744860.png><p>Arias was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced to life in prison</a> without the possibility of parole in April of&nbsp;2015.</p><p>Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conviction was upheld by the Arizona Court of Appeals</a> in March.</p><p>She is serving her sentence at the Arizona State Prison Complex.</p><h2>Was Travis Alexander mormon?&nbsp;</h2><p>Alexander was a mormon.&nbsp;</p><p>Arias converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which Alexander was a member of and was baptized by him in November of 2006.</p><h2
