She captioned the post, “Cowboy take me away … #lucasfriar #girlmeetsworld.”</p><p>Fans were stunned. In the comments, one person wrote, "Imagine being able to brag that you pulled your Disney crush," while another added that TAELA had “flexed SO HARD.” Just a few days later, TAELA showed off her man again with an Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> of the two getting extremely cozy. She captioned the image, “What’s wrong with me? Why do I feel like this?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Peyton made the relationship official, too, when he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a picture with TAELA on Valentine’s Day, captioning it with a single red heart. Since then, there’s been a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">steady stream</a> of posts showing the two of them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loved up</a>, and even a picture of Peyton and TAELA’s son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">River</a> (who seems to be from TAELA's previous relationship), having a cuddle on her porch in Nashville.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peyton Meyer married TAELA in Oct. 2021.</h2><p>The couple posted wedding photos to their respective Instagram pages on Oct. 12.
