They decided on joint legal custody of their 10-year-old daughter, Ashby, and neither will pay spousal or child support. They also divvied up their property.

Their top priority is their three children,” a source told Us in September 2016, referring to Tyler and Carson, Zubchevich’s sons from a previous marriage.</p><p>The TV personality made headlines in October 2016 after she was identified as the married woman who <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> referenced during a 2005 recorded conversation with then-Access Hollywood host <a href=#><strong>Billy Bush</strong></a>.
