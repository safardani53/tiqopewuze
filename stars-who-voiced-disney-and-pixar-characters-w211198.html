They were my escape. My adventures. My dreams,” the&nbsp;<i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>tweeted</a>&nbsp;at the time. “They were my first window into the magic of storytelling and performing.

I can’t believe that I get to be a part of the Pixar family and work with these truly brilliant artists who tell stories unlike anyone else. Watching them work is nothing short of magic.
