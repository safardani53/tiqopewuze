All of a sudden you feel a little bit different about yourself. Sometimes you just need to feel a million dollars - and he does now.</p><span class=quote-credit>Mark McCall</span><p>So with Jones still undecided on his back-up to Leicester Tigers ace Ben Youngs, McCall reckons the case is now closed with</p><p>Harlequins back Danny Care out of favour and Wasps pocket-rocket Dan Robson struggling with blood clots in his legs.</p><p>Asked if Spencer should start packing his bags for the World Cup, McCall said: "I would be surprised if he's not in Japan.</p><p>"His self-belief has gone through the roof. All of a sudden you feel a little bit different about yourself.</p><p>"He has always been skilful and a good enough passer, quick enough and a good kicker.</p><p>"Sometimes you just need to feel a million dollars - and he does now. Had he been exposed to international rugby when he was 22 I'm not sure how would have been ready.</p><p>"This is exactly the perfect time for him, I do admire his patience, but there has always been a plan and he knew when his starts and benches were coming.</p><p>"His battle has been to get selected for European Cup matches and that is what is happening at the moment."</p><p>Spencer has been wrapped up in cotton wool for today's game against Exeter Chiefs with both sides having booked a home play-off place.</p><p>The likely dress rehearsal for the Premiership final on June 1 is also a chance for McCall to rest a whole string of his key men, with full-back Alex Goode also getting the chance to put his feet up.</p><p>Goode is a front-runner for the Champions Cup player-of-the-season award, but is shockingly still ignored at Test level by Jones.</p><p>And McCall said: "We want all of our players to get what they deserve and he has been brilliant for our club for so long. Sometimes it is hard to fathom.</p><p>"That's not in our control, but what is in our control is how well Alex is playing and most people think he's playing pretty well.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SPORT</h2></p><p>"Alex has had another phenomenal year and it hasn't just been at full-back this year, but fly-half as well. He has played some really important games for us.</p><p>"I think he has really enjoyed the year as well because he has had something else to get his teeth into - which is looking like a very good, composed fly-half, which is also where he sued to play.</p><p>"He has enjoyed that double challenge of playing full-back to a high level and fly-half to a high level."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000485809959.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Billy Vunipola - I believe in what I believe in.
