I used to grow up watching Ed McMahon, and so many great artists actually came through Star Search," Legend told Fallon. "I would watch the show and I was like, 'I wanna be on there, I deserve to be on there!' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Legend, 42, said that he was so passionate about the show that he entered a competition as a kid when Star Search came to his local mall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My local mall, it was called the Fairfield Commons Mall, outside Dayton, Ohio, they had a local Star Search competition and if you won the local competition they would send your tape to national Star Search," he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "All of You" artist said he ended up winning the competition but was never asked to move forward with the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I won the local Star Search competition, they sent my videotape to the national Star Search, and I never got a call back," he said. "That was that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While EGOT-winner didn't get his shot on the singing show, Legend said he was at least given a consolation prize.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I did get a $500 shopping spree at the new mall and I bought a lot of clothes, so I was happy," he added to Fallon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Legend recently opened up about his early love for music in an episode of Facebook Watch's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Forward: The Future of Black Music</a> in celebration of Black History Month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While chatting with Grammy-nominated rising star and Rhythm + Flow winner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>D Smoke</a>, Legend said he's been perfecting his craft since age 4.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When did you first start playing the keys?" Smoke (n√© Daniel Farris), 35, asked. "When was the first time you sat down and was like, 'Okay, I'm gonna do this for myself?'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Probably a lot like you, we had a piano in our house growing up," PEOPLE's former Sexiest Man Alive recalled. "I saw it there and I was like, 'Well, obviously it's meant to be played.'"</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>John Legend.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/BBMA2020/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's when the "Bigger Love" hitmaker decided it was time to start learning. "I was like, 'Mom, I wanna take piano lessons.' I was 4 years old," he said. "I started taking classical piano lessons at 4 and then my grandmother was our church organist and she started to show me how to play gospel music when I was like 7 or 8."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, he added, "I had gotten to the point where I could play for the church." But Legend quickly quipped, "I wasn't that great back then."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The icon credits his childhood influencers for molding him into artist he is today. "That's really where I became a musician. You know the feeling? I wouldn't be where I am without that experience," he told D Smoke, who agreed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjqOmoaZdobKosc2dZKudk5a5rb%2BMm5yippdiv6a2xJyrnpxdm7%2BwuYysq5qqXaiyor7CoWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
