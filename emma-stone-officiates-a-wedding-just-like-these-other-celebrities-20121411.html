Stone "didn't seem nervous at all," an eyewitness told Us Weekly. The actress, who introduced the bride and groom, shared personal stories about both of them (she's known Shakoor for six years; Fleischer directed her in 2009's "Zombieland"). "They always credited Emma with them finding each other, so having her officiate the wedding was a no brainer," the wedding guest told the magazine.</p><p>[Related: <a href=#>Emma Stone Officiates Wedding of Publicist, Director</a>]</p><p>Stone, who was accompanied by beau Andrew Garfield at the wedding, isn't the first celebrity to help a couple say "I do." When Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner tied the knot on the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2005, the wedding was so low-key and small that not even her parents attended. Who was there? Garner's "Alias" co-star Victor Garber, who married the couple on the beach. Garber, who is also the godfather of the couple's daughter Violet, has said that his friendship with Garner developed while spending long hours on the set of the ABC spy show. "We liked each other, but it was over a period of time that we found out we have the same values, same sense of humor mostly it evolved from laughing," he told Entertainment Weekly. Affleck is also a Garber fan he cast him in "Argo."</p><p>When Howard Stern made an honest woman out of Beth Ostrosky in 2008, they asked their close pal Mark Consuelos to pronounce them husband and wife at their posh New York City nuptials. Kelly Ripa has said that the couple picked her husband because, "They like Mark and we're friends. And they knew Mark would do a great job, which he did." Consuelos later joked that becoming ordained online was easy "It took my assistant about 15 minutes and $43 to become an official" but that was his first and last time performing a wedding. "I kind of retired after that one," the "American Horror Story: Asylum" actor laughed. "I still have a lot of people ask me. In retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have stopped. It could be a nice little side job."</p><p>Some other famous folks who have had a fellow celebrity marry them? When American Ferrera tied the knot with Ryan Piers Williams in 2011, she held the wedding at her "Ugly Betty" co-star Vanessa Williams' lavish Chappaqua, New York, estate and tapped Judith Light, who was also on the series, to preside over the ceremony. In addition, Nicole Richie and Joel Madden were married by Rev Run in 2010 the same year "The Office" star Jenna Fischer and writer Lee Kirk were married by Jeff Probst.</p><p>But you don't have to be famous to have a celebrity help you get hitched! In 2008, Kathy Griffin married a Queens, New York, couple who were huge fans of "My Life on the D-List" and you probably won't be surprised to hear there were many LOLs throughout the ceremony. Griffin, whose assistant also helped her become ordained online, "had us all in hysterics during the ceremony" bride Elka Shapiro later told the New York Daily News. Griffin's 10-minute service included naughty language and X-rated jokes about the couple's sex life. She also grilled them about the food offerings at the reception. "What did you get for the boring vegetarians and vegans? They're such a pain at these things," the comedian cracked in the middle of the ceremony. So why did she do it? "The request came in and how could I say no? I love that this couple just want to have fun. They're my kind of people."</p><p>Jason Segel couldn't say no either when Abbe Thorner and Jason Wood approached him in a West Hollywood bar of all places! and asked him to do the honors when they took the plunge. "I guess the guys who were supposed to officiate their wedding dropped out and they were watching '[Forgetting] Sarah Marshall' at the time Ã³which, I mean, most people are so they convinced me that I would be an appropriate person to officiate their wedding." The "How I Met Your Mother" star later brought the couple with him to a 2010 appearance on "The Tonight Show" and married them there.</p><p>Other celebs offering their services to strangers? Tori Spelling married a couple staying at her bed and breakfast, Chateau La Rue, in 2007. "I've done live theater and presented at the Emmys and this by far was my scariest moment," Spelling later said. "I didn't want to let them down." And Fran Drescher held a contest on Facebook earlier this year where the winners were treated to having the "Happily Divorced" star officiate their same-sex marriage ceremony in New York. But the sassy actress wasn't anxious at all about her big role in the couple's nuptials. "People ask if I'll be nervous officiating the ceremony, and I say, 'Please, I may have gotten my minister's license, but I'm still a Jewish woman, and if there's one thing we're comfortable doing, it's giving orders!"</p><p><strong>More celebrity features on Yahoo!:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Keira Knightley talks nude scenes: I don't mind exposing my breasts!</a></p><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez: Is it really over?</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Matthew McConaughey looks unrecognizable on the set of 'The Dallas Buyers Club' (video)</a></p><p><a href=#>Follow omg! on Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaepZ2WerTAzqecZqeWm7aktcCtnKxlkWLEprDDoqWgZZqqwLV5y6KinmWknbK0sYyoq6GdomKwprjEm6mirJmawG5%2Bj2ppamxhZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
