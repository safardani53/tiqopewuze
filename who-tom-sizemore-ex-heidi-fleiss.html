They need someone who’s a little bit kooky like me to stand up for them."</p><p>Heidi lived in Nevada for over 15 years, but in January 2022, she revealed plans to leave after one of her parrots was shot with a pellet gun, according to <a aria-label="The Guardian (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>She reportedly bought a property in <a href=#>Missouri</a> and has since relocated there.</p><h2>What happened to Tom Sizemore?</h2><p>Sizemore was rushed to the ER on February 18, 2023, after <a href=#>suffering from a brain aneurysm</a> in his home.
