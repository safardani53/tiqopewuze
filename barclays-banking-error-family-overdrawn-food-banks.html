debt.</p><p>The Livermore family, from Worthing, have been forced to seek help from friends and family after their three Barclays accounts were each left £500,000 in debt.</p><img

mum Kayleigh, both 31, have struggled to keep the family afloat and feed their three kids, aged 11, eight and seven due to what appears to have been a banking error.</p><p>Paul says the three accounts were all in credit before Easter weekend, but each had a deficit of around £500,000 afterwards.</p><p>He says he never had an overdraft in place but had agreed an emergency £10 buffer with the high street bank.</p><p>With the massive deficit, they defaulted on their payments for their car, tax, rent and phone bills.</p><img

account was suspended for ten working days and then they told me the accounts were going to be held indefinitely under investigation.</p><p>"The bank has also texted me saying that bills have not been paid and our mobile phone accounts have been suspended for outgoing calls as well as the home internet.</p><p>"We have pretty much been living off hand outs since Easter Monday, I have never been in a situation like this before and it is so embarrassing to ask for so much help.</p><p>"The kids are managing and we are making sure they are eating, they have lunch at school.</p><p>"The food bank gave us a lot of vegetables, fruit and items for the cupboard as well as some bread and milk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

need, it is really overwhelming how supportive everyone has been.</p><p>Paul is currently in negotiations with his bosses to try to free up some cash but has so far been unsuccessful.</p><p>He added: "I cried when I saw the figure, I was gobsmacked and didn't know what was going on.</p><p>"It's so confusing and stressful, we have missed payments for our car finance, tax and rent because of this."</p><p>Paul has no access to his accounts and has complained to Barclays but has yet to receive an explanation for the issue.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN

for over 15 years, it's not good enough."</p><p>Barclays have confirmed they are investigating the matter, but are currently unable to ascertain how long the matter will take to get sorted.</p><p>A Barclays spokesman told The Sun Online:&nbsp;“This is a rare and isolated incident which we are investigating as a matter of urgency.</p><p>"We are liaising with our customer to swiftly resolve the
