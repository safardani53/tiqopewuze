The talented star split from her boyfriend <strong>Riley King</strong> in June, after dating for two years, and released a statement about the relationship status change during an interview. “For the most part, it was great,” she told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;during an appearance at&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Country Live. “People date to see if they’re gonna go the distance, and we weren’t. We just simply were not right for each other, and that’s the bottom line. I am on such a beautiful journey, and I am really excited about the next chapter of my life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Riley also confirmed the split with a statement. “Yes, things didn’t work out,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six&nbsp;</a>on Wednesday, June 7. “Carly and I have parted ways and I wish her nothing but the best in both her career and personal life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZpyZoqHGbrzEmqmcnV2brq240mamp2Wjqa6osYyvoJ2dn2K%2Fpq3Crapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
