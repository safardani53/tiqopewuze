No, scratch that — wherever they go. Yes, even <a href=#>after Carrie Underwood’s terrible accident</a>.</p><p>But there’s more to keeping a marriage alive than outrageous good looks. Or even than sharing a child together.</p><p>According to a new report, Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher are headed for divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/mike-fisher-and-carrie-underwood-680x1024.jpg><p>It’s been a little over a year since the last time that we heard <a href=#>divorce rumors about Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher</a>.</p><p>At the time, the couple was said to be squabbling over their life plans.</p><p>Carrie Fisher was touring all of the time because, you know, she has a music career.</p><p>It was reported that the couple had initially agreed to have four children, but so far has only one — little Isaiah.</p><p>So it was allegedly Mike Fisher who was unhappy with their marriage because their family wasn’t growing quickly enough for his tastes. But apparently, whatever it was, they worked it out, because that was all in late 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/carrie-underwood-and-husband-mike-fisher-1024x680.jpg><p>Now, however, InTouch Weekly reports that <a href=#>Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher will divorce</a> for different reasons.</p><p>"She and Mike love each other, but like any couple they’ve had challenges."</p><p>But, according to their source, it’s become too much.</p><p>"So much so that at times, Carrie has been at the breaking point."</p><p>Part of the alleged trouble in their marriage stems from similar issues that arose before.</p><p>"Just by the very nature of their jobs, Carrie is gone on long concert tours and Mike was away playing for the team a lot."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/carrie-underwood-and-mike-fisher-cmts-705x1024.jpg><p>It sounds like, this time, Carrie’s the one who’s unhappy. Well, unhappier.</p><p>"Carrie has wanted more quality time with Mike. They’ve only been on a couple of vacations together in the seven years they’ve been married."</p><p>Mike recently retired from hockey … and then turned around and got back on the ice to work with a different team.</p><p>"She really thought that Mike’s retirement was going to give them the time they needed to work on making their family stronger."</p><p>Mike Fisher’s ice fever — or whatever — may end up costing him his marriage.</p><p>"His decision put a huge strain on their marriage. If Carrie and Mike continue to grow apart, it will surely end in divorce for them. And that would be heartbreaking."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/carrie-underwood-and-mike-fisher-cmas-1024x699.jpg><p>It does sound like the size of their family continues to be an alleged issue for Carrie and Mike.</p><p>"Carrie’s been desperate to have a little brother or sister for Isaiah. But she’s been struggling to get pregnant."</p><p>Well, they’re both gorgeous, but that doesn’t mean that they’re getting any younger.</p><p>"She was hoping Mike would become more involved in the process of possible&nbsp;IVF&nbsp;treatments, if it came to that."</p><p>It seems that there may be some communication issues.</p><p>"[Mike] isn’t always cognizant of Carrie’s feelings and needs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Divorce would almost be a last resort for these two, however.</p><p>Carrie has stated in the past that she believes that God brought her and Mike together. Her faith is extremely important to her, and she reportedly feels like ending her marriage would have religious implications.</p><p>But this source claims that she may be out of options.</p><p>"If Carrie and Mike continue to grow apart, they will have no choice but to divorce."</p><p>We wish Carrie and Mike the best, of course. We hope that they can resolve their differences happily as they’ve done before.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>31 Photos of Carrie Underwood Being Gorgeous and Awesome</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2FcK%2FAq6minV2qu6Wx0bCmqJxdlrulecyiop5llp7AqbHRZp%2BemZSasW6yzqtknaGmpL%2BksY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
