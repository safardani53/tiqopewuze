In the UK, this consists simply of a suit in black or dark grey with a white shirt and dark tie, preferably in black.</p><p>A black shirt is also appropriate as well as white, but you should always wear black shoes above any colour.</p><p>Putting some effort into presentation is considered respectful. Ensure that your shirt is well ironed and your shoes freshly polished. If wearing cufflinks or jewellery, keep them smart and understated.</p><p>Remember that in winter you may need to wear a coat as well. Again, wearing something smart and in a sombre colour will be the most appropriate option.</p><h2><b>What to wear to a more relaxed funeral</b></h2><p>Some people specify that they do not want their funerals to be so formal, or their families may make the same request of guests.</p><p>In this case, it is still best to keep your outfit relatively smart and subdued — but you can opt to not wear a suit here. For example, wear a crew neck jumper with chinos or tailored trousers and smart shoes. Choose dark colours to remain respectful while also feeling more at ease.</p><h2><b>What to wear to a memorial service</b></h2><p>Memorial services usually take place some time after a person has passed away, and serve as a celebration of that person’s life and a space to remember them. In this case, the mood is usually less sombre.</p><p>It is still considered respectful to dress smartly, but it is not necessary to be totally formal, and it’s fine to wear colours and patterns.</p><p>A navy suit would be an appropriate option, or a blazer and chinos for a more casual look. Try a plain shirt with a patterned tie or a striped shirt with a plain tie.</p><p>While brighter colours are fine, this is not the time to experiment with bold tones or clashes — keep things fairly simple for a respectful look.</p><h2>How much are the best funeral clothes for men?</h2><p>If you're looking to buy a full suit, you can pick up some really stylish and affordable tailoring these days.</p><p>We rate New Look for quality and price: you can shop some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">men's black blazer</a> for £49.99 and a pair of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">black suit trousers</a> for just £15.19.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you're happy to spend a little more, the likes of <a href=#>John Lewis</a> and <a href=#>Reiss</a> are great for sleek tailoring: expect to pay upwards of £50 for trousers and £75 and up for suit jackets.</p><h2>Where to buy funeral clothes for men</h2><p>You don't necessarily have to go to a tailor to buy your funeral outfit: the high street is awash with quality tailoring at affordable prices.</p><p>Stores like John Lewis, M&S, Next and Moss have a stylish selection of quality jackets, shirts, trousers and shoes that will look smart and appropriate on the day – and can be worn for plenty of other occasions, besides.</p><p>If you're on more of a budget, check out New Look, River Island and Matalan which are great for smart staples that won't break the bank.</p><p>Meanwhile, for footwear, you can also try Office, Shuh and Jones Bootmaker for funeral-appropriate black brogues and smart shoes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS FASHION</h2></p><p>If you found our roundup of w<span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"What to wear to a funeral for men"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":513,"3":{"1":0},"12":0}'>hat menswear to buy for a funeral useful, you</span>&nbsp;might also like our selection of the best <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trench coats for men</a>, to wear over your suit.</p><p>Plus, check out our <a href=#>review of stitch fix</a> - a personal shopping subscription service delivering carefully curated menswear outfits to your door.</p><p>And check out our dedicated Sun Selects <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fashion section</a> for more style tips, trends and products.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFvYWqFdIOOsJ%2BarF2pvG7DxJqpZp6lo7KzrctmpJ6mXaKur3nMnqSoqpmWuW6%2FxKutopuVYsSit8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
