In order to get revenge, he&nbsp;joins an eclectic underground band of Nazi hunters led by Holocaust survivor Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to showrunner David Weil, Lerman was more than just an actor in the series. He was “the beating heart of the production” who worked hard to help create a collaborative set by producing and giving ideas for scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The spotlight had been off The Perks of Being a Wallflower star for a while before Hunters, but with season 2 well underway, the actor is immersed in his work. And when he is not working, he is busy with his girlfriend. For those out of the loop on “Who is Logan Lerman dating,” here is a breakdown of the actor’s love life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Logan Lerman’s Girlfriend</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Lerman is currently in a relationship with Analuisa Corrigan. However, it is unconfirmed when the two started dating, as they are private about their relationship and hardly post about each other on social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, we know they have been together since the beginning of last year as Corrigan uploaded a series of adorable snaps of her and Lerman in honor of the actor’s birthday. She kept the caption short and sweet with “Happy Logie Day.”</p><p>Corrigan is an artist based in Los Angeles and New York. She graduated with a BFA in Communication Designs from Parsons, The New School of Design. She has been working within several mediums for the past ten years, including clay, paint, and printed matter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Much of her ceramic artwork is featured on her Instagram. But she had no intention of pursuing ceramic art when she became an artist. Instead, after being bored with her sedentary lifestyle as an intern at an advertising agency, she bought a bag of clay on a whim and started playing with it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She found it therapeutic and soon realized&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she wanted to grow her craft</a>. According to her website, as a ceramic artist, her work is about the “fragility and integrity of clay as a material and practice.” Her abstract-shaped lamps are commercially available.&nbsp;</p><h2>Logan Lerman’s Engagement</h2><p>Before Corrigan, Lerman almost made a wife out of his&nbsp;Percy Jackson&nbsp;co-star Alexandra Daddario.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple was private about their relationship; therefore, the timeline of their relationship is a little hazy. However, they were spotted a few times in different cities in the U.S, and according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Inquisitr</a>, they were even engaged in 2016.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, the&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;star and the&nbsp;Fury&nbsp;actor broke off their engagement and moved on with their lives. Daddario shared with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Women’s Health</a>&nbsp;in May 2017 that she was single and actively dating, and currently, she is&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>dating producer Andrew Form</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress is not coy about divulging the details of her relationship as she often shares photos of her with Form on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSfnK6vecueqaaZnmK0qr7Ln6minZ6Ze6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
