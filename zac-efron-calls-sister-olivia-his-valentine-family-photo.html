The <a href=#>High School Musical</a> star <a href=#>posed shirtless</a> as he read from a picture book.</p><p>The Neighbors actor has frequently showcased <a href=#>his relationship with Olivia</a>, who was born in 2019. His parents — <strong>David Efron</strong> and <strong>Starla Baskett</strong> — called it quits in 2016. Along with Olivia — who is <a href=#>David’s daughter from his second marriage</a> — Zac is big brother to <a href=#><strong>Dylan Efron</strong></a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</a> alum previously <a href=#>shared a cuddly snap with Olivia</a> in July 2021, calling her a “little heartbreaker.” When she <a href=#>celebrated her 3rd birthday</a> in December 2022, Zac gave a glimpse of Olivia’s fun-filled bash.</p><p>“Happy bday lil sis 👸,” he gushed at the time, posting two pics from the party. In one photo, the birthday girl closed her eyes as she leaned in for a hug. Zac gave Olivia a sweet kiss on top of her head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Zac-Efron-Calls-Baby-Sister-Olivia-His-Valentine-in-Swoon-Worthy-Pic.jpg><p>“What’s [sic] Christmas is all about. Love to see it. ❤️❤️,” <a href=#><strong>Bart Johnson</strong></a> — who played Troy Bolton’s dad in <a href=#>the High School Musical franchise</a> — wrote in the comments section at the time.</p><p>Dylan, 31, teased in a comment of his own: “I think we spoiled her ❤️.”</p><p>The Hairspray actor is serious about <a href=#>his big sibling duties</a>, but he isn’t quite ready to have a little one of his own. While promoting his movie Firestarter — in which he played a father for the first time — Zac confessed that <a href=#>he wasn’t in a hurry to be parent</a> off screen.</p><p>“All of a sudden I had this daughter in front of me. We had a pretty heavy dad-daughter scene right off the bat, and I realized I was drastically underprepared for this part,” he joked on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> in May 2022. “I didn’t know what I was doing. I thought it would just kind of click, but no, that’s not really the case!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The California native noted that having costar <strong>Ryan Kiera Armstrong</strong>, then 12, by his side made a big difference. “Luckily, Ryan is just so sweet, she’s just the coolest, and after two days, we had the best bond, so that part got really easy,” he added. “[But] I think that was a healthy dose to put me off of [having kids] for as long as necessary.”</p><p>Zac appeared to get flustered by the idea of <a href=#>welcoming children of his own</a>, pointing out that he has “a little bit more growing to do, probably,” before jumping into fatherhood. “I have a healthy respect for parents. I’m very grateful for them all,” he said, giving a sweet wave to his mom in the audience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGazmZNisqe%2BzqdknJmcocBuv8isq56qXaS5qsLImmShoaNiw6K4xKeroqaVYrOiucilsGaomKTBsHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
