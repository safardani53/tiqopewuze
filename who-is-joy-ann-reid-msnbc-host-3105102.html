The longtime anchor for the network, 51, has been tapped to host The ReidOut, a new show airing weeknights at 7:00pm — the time slot held by Hardball for 23 years. Before Joy moves from mornings to evenings on July 20, here’s what you should know about her:</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. She the host of AM Joy.&nbsp;</strong>Reid has hosted the political weekend morning talk show on MSNBC since May 2016. She also frequently subs in for other network hosts like <strong>Chris Hayes</strong> and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Rachel Maddow</strong></a>. As of 2018, her morning show averages nearly one million weekly viewers. Loyal fans refer to themselves on social media as #reiders. Reid, the child of immigrants, rose to prominence as a vocal critic of President <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>, and is known for her no-nonsense interviews with his surrogates.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>““Our prime directive is to constantly remind people that this is not normal and not to allow it to become mundane,” Reid told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a> in 2018. “We feel like one of our duties is to keep that story top of mind because it’s fundamentally about whether we truly choose our own leaders.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/joy-reid-5-things-rex-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>2. She’s taking over Chris Matthews’ time slot on the network. </strong>Veteran Hardball anchor Chris Matthews abruptly resigned from the network, on-air, in March 2020. Matthews, 74, was forced out after a series of on-air gaffes, including comparing the presidential campaign of Senator <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong></a>, who is Jewish, to the Nazi invasion of France during World War II.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Matthews was also accused of making inappropriate and sexist comments to women at the network. “I’m retiring,” Matthews told viewers in a monologue at the beginning of the March 2 episode. “This is the last Hardball on MSNBC.” It came as a complete shock to his colleagues. Matthews had hosted Hardball since 1997.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>3. She cites fellow Black female journalists Gwen Ifill, Deborah Roberts, and Carole Simpson as her heroes. </strong>“Evening and prime-time news has been a universe of white men really since I was growing up,” Reid told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. “For somebody who grew up as a nerdy kid obsessed with news, watching Nightline and Meet the Press, the idea of being a part of that family has always just been kind of overwhelming.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/joy-reid-5-things-rex-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>4. She was accused of homophobia in 2018 after decade-old, offensive posts were found on her blog.&nbsp;</strong>Posts on Reid’s dormant blog, The Reid Report, speculated that Republican governor of Florida <strong>Charlie Crist</strong> was a closeted gay man and married a woman as a coverup. There were also posts that condemned gay sex, degraded lesbians, promoted offensive stereotypes about LGBTQ+ people, and claimed Reid couldn’t watch Brokeback Mountain. The FBI launched an investigation into potential criminal activity on the site, as Reid <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>claimed the site had been hacked</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>apologized on air</a> for what has been found on her blog. “I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me. But I can definitely understand, based on things I have tweeted, have written in the past, why some people don’t believe me,” she said on MSNBC. “For that, I am truly, truly sorry.” She also apologized to <strong>Ann Coulter</strong>, whom she suggested was a man in several tweets from 2010 and 2011. “I want to apologize to the trans community and to Ann,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>5. She teaches a college course for Syracuse University’s communications school.</strong> The S.I. Newhouse School Of Public Communications has a program called Newhouse In NYC that allows media students to spend a semester interning and taking classes in New York. Reid teaches the “Race, Gender & The Media” course at the school’s midtown satellite campus. The journalist, however, isn’t a Cuse alum. She graduated from Harvard in 1991 with a concentration in film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3sMWMmqWnZaKatqV5zKylm5tdnby0wIxsaGltYWV%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
