People born in the year of the rat like saving and collecting. They never face financial difficulties and lead orderly lifestyles. If a rat gives you a valuable present, know that he thinks highly of you because he doesn't normally open his wallet for others. Rats do not want praise or recognition. They are extremely sensitive and can detect problems. They are generally successful when they take chances.</p><p>People born on February 24 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Daughter of acclaimed Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt and star of several popular Bollywood films.
