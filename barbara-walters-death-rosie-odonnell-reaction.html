The two worked together on The View, which Walters created, from 2006 to 2007.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What a long and eventful legendary life she had," O'Donnell, 60, continued, remembering the newscaster's longevity. "Spoke to every prominent world leader in memory, interviewed everyone who's anyone, and I was lucky enough to be in her orbit for a good many years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reflecting on the time they had spent together, O'Donnell added, "We saw a lot of Broadway shows together, and whenever we go backstage, I'd, like, try to help her, you know, over the steps backstage and she would always smack my hand and tell me to leave her alone. She [knew] what she was doing I could tell you that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"May she rest in peace and may everyone remember just what barriers she broke down for women," she concluded. "She really did, she was the first, and will always be remembered."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O'Donnell and Walters had a fair share of ups and downs in their friendship throughout the years.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Marc Bryan-Brown/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Donald Trump</a> verbally attacked O'Donnell after she made negative comments about him on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The View</a> in 2007, Page Six reported O'Donnell felt Walters didn't stand up for her strongly enough — and said as much to her boss backstage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, a spokesperson for the show told PEOPLE, "From the first day Rosie spoke about Donald Trump, Barbara has been nothing but supportive of Rosie.

Everyone has moved on."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, in Ramin Setoodeh's book about The View, Ladies Who Punch, the author detailed O'Donnell and Walters' extended falling out, which stemmed from tensions on set and the release of O'Donnell's book, Celebrity Detox. Reportedly upset with her portrayal in the tome, Walters arranged to have a portion of the book leaked to the New York Post — asking the outlet to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>include a psychologist evaluation</a> of O'Donnell's mental health in its coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Barbara Walters, Legendary Broadcaster and Creator of 'The View,' Dead at 93</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The article came out in September 2007 and featured a psychiatrist calling O'Donnell <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"full of rage</a>," suggesting she "dishes out anger mostly to women because of deep-seated abandonment issues over her mother's death." The piece also included a statement from Walters, in which she called O'Donnell's memoir a "sad book, but I prefer to focus on the happier times we had and the happier times we hope to have in the future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Walters' death was confirmed on Friday by her rep Cindi Berger who told PEOPLE: "Barbara Walters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>passed away peacefully in her home</a> surrounded by loved ones. She lived a big life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She lived her life with no regrets," Berger's statement continued.
