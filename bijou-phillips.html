Her parents named her after the song “My Petite Bijou.” Bijou is a French word that means “jewel.” Her father was the well-known American singer John Phillips, and her mother was a South African actress, model, and artist named Genevieve Waite. She is the last of her father’s three marriages’ children. Bijou has one sibling and three half-siblings.</p><p>Bijou was placed in foster care in Boston Landing, New York, in 1985, where she lived intermittently. Her parents were both found unfit to raise her following their divorce. She used to visit her parents in foster care after they had both moved to Boston Landing and purchased homes there.</p><p>Her father won custody when she was in third grade, and she moved in with him. Her half-sister later told her about her incestuous relationship with her father. According to Bijou, this information influenced her life as a teen and her relationship with her father. Bijou had dropped out of school at the age of 14 and rented her own apartment. She became rebellious, believing that it was due to partying and drugs.</p><h2>Bijou Phillips Age, Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Bijou Phillips</strong> was born on April 1, 1980, and is 42 years old as of 2022.

Bijou became Calvin Klein’s image model in several campaigns featuring adolescents wearing white underwear. The public reacted negatively to the campaigns, which were labeled paedophilic. Bijou never wanted to be a model, and when she was seventeen, she found her way out through music. On May 11, 1999, she released her debut album, I’d Rather Eat Glass. She has only ever released one full-length music album.</p><p>She made her film debut in 1999, playing a minor role in the drama Sugar Town. This was just a taste of what was to come, as she was cast in a major role in a Black and White drama. She has since appeared in numerous films, with the years 2000-2005 serving as her breakthrough season in the film industry. Her most recent appearance was in the Raising Hope drama, after which she decided to take a break and focus on her health and family.</p><h2>Bijou Phillips Achievements and Awards</h2><p><strong>Bijou Phillips</strong> has never won an award for her work as an actress or musician. Her music career did not take off, as she has only released one album since 1999. She has done well in acting, and her career only suffered when she took a sabbatical for health reasons.</p><h2>Bijou Phillips’s Net Worth In 2023</h2><p><strong>Bijou Phillips</strong> began working as a model when she was thirteen years old. Calvin Klein approached her and offered her a lucrative contract to model and advertise their underwear. Her music career did not take off, and she has made the majority of her money through her acting career. As of October 2023, her net worth is estimated to be $20 million.</p><p>Bijou Phillips has been one of her father’s defenders in the face of her half-incest sister’s allegations. Her father was many things to her, but not what her half-sister accused him of. Since 2017, her husband has also been accused of rape and stalking. Despite the fact that her husband has not responded to the allegations, she has defended him and even mocked his accuser, Carne Bixler.</p><h2>Bijou Phillips Husband, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Bijou Phillips</strong> met Danny Masterson, another Scientologist, in a poker tournament in 2004, and the two began dating. They announced their engagement in March 2009, and after two years of planning, they married on October 18, 2011, in an Irish castle. On February 14, 2014, the couple welcomed their firstborn daughter Fianna Masterson, which was a perfect way to celebrate Valentine’s Day.</p><p>On February 17, 2017, her husband revealed that Bijou had been suffering from kidney disease for five years. He revealed that his wife was born with small kidneys, a condition that forced her to change her lifestyle by reducing stress, eating a vegan diet, and having dialysis to clean her kidneys. She later developed a blood infection and required a kidney transplant, which she received on April 7, 2017.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZoqKfqnqxtMilo6Koo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
