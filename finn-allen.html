He graduated from secondary school at Saint Kentigern College in Auckland. He always went through the age-level process for playing cricket to build his drive and confidence, and he quickly found himself playing in Auckland in the under-17 squad. He was then named to the under-19 team as well.</p><p>As Finn went for the bowling throughout his 71-run innings, he also manages to hit 10 fours and three sixes. In addition to saving his life, he achieved his half-century with just 18 balls. This is an impressive record since it was the second-fastest fifty by a New Zealander. As a result of Sams’ absence, he has more of a chance for the club RCB management to look into boosting their batting. Allen was also picked for New Zealand’s Twenty20 International (T20I) team for their series against Bangladesh in March 2021. He also made his T20I debut for New Zealand against Bangladesh on March 28, 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Finn-Allen-1-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Finn Allen Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Finn Allen</strong> is a New Zealander who stands 6’1′ tall.
