The exes also agreed to a “parenting plan” for son 10-year-old son Tennessee.</p><p>Witherspoon and the talent manager announced their decision to <a href=#>call it quits after 11 years of marriage</a> in March.</p><p>“We have some personal news to share … It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the former couple said in a joint statement shared via <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the time. “We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness and <a href=#>mutual respect for everything</a> we have created together.”</p><p>They continued: “Our biggest priority is our son and our entire family as we <a href=#>navigate this next chapter</a>. These matters are never easy and are extremely personal. We truly appreciate everyone’s respect for our family’s privacy at this time.”</p><p>Less than a week later, Us Weekly confirmed that Witherspoon <a href=#>officially filed for divorce</a> from Toth, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the cause for their split. According to documents obtained by Us at the time, the twosome signed a <a href=#>prenuptial agreement</a> ahead of their 2011 wedding.</p><p>Ahead of their eventual divorce, the pair were <a href=#>seemingly preparing for the end</a> of their relationship. In a December 2021 issue of Us Weekly, a source revealed that Witherspoon and Toth had been <a href=#>quietly dividing assets</a> for years prior to the announcement of their separation.</p><p>“They decided their marriage wasn’t going to last forever and that they should have a plan for splitting up their assets that wouldn’t destroy what they built together,” the insider explained at the time.</p><p>Witherspoon and Toth tied the knot in March 2011 <a href=#>after dating for nearly one year</a>. News of their breakup came two days before their 12th wedding anniversary which would have been on March 26.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to Tennessee, whom they welcomed in September 2012, Witherspoon is also the mother of daughter Ava, 23, and son Deacon, 19, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong></a>.</p><p>Following her split from Toth, <a href=#>rumors began to swirl</a> in April that Witherspoon <a href=#>had moved on</a> with <a href=#><strong>Tom Brady</strong></a> — who also went through a public divorce of his own with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong></a> late last year after 13 years of marriage. However, a source told Us that the rumors were “totally ridiculous,” adding that Witherspoon <a href=#>wasn’t dating at the moment</a> since she had just ended her 12-year marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarnZWosm7DyK2fnqqjpbywuoyapZ1lmp66bsDOrZ9mq5Wpwa2xjK2fnqGiYrGqws6rmp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
