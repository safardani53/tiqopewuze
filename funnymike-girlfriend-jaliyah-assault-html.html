She was arrested because of the incident.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But now, it looks like she is out of jail. Mike revealed in his stories that she was out of custody now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Details on FunnyMike's&nbsp;Girlfriend Jaliyah's Arrest</h2><p>According to documents and facts <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">obtained by Busted Newspaper</a>, Jaliyah was arrested on January 25, 2022, in Fort Bend County, Texas.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The charges&nbsp;mentioned on the documents implied she was involved in an assault case. It noted, "Assault causes bodily inj fam viol."</p><p>This means she was possibly&nbsp;involved in assaulting a family member, causing bodily injuries.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>No bond amount was mentioned in the document, so we do not know how much she paid to get out. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Further details like jurisdiction and other information about the bond were also absent from the document.</p><p></p><p><strong>Documents showing FunnyMike's girlfriend's&nbsp;arrest details and mugshot after domestic violence case.</strong> (Photo: Busted Newspaper/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Busted Newspaper's documents also revealed Jaliyah's&nbsp;mugshot taken at the time of the arrest. Her physical state on the mugshot further solidified the charges brought against her.</p><p>In the headshot, she looked unwell. Her right eye was blue and bruised. Similarly, she seemed to have a small injury right below her left eye.</p><p>Further, there were dark marks on her forehead as well. Those looked like bruises, but we do not know for certain. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her hair was messed up, and she was dressed in what looked like dark-colored jail clothing.</p><p>These all suggest she was at the receiving end of some physical assault as well.</p><p>Elsewhere in the document, the time of her booking was mentioned. It stated 01:45:00.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The documents available also did not reveal whether she was the only one arrested or there were multiple offenders brought in.</p><h2>Fans Ask FunnyMike If He Was Involved</h2><p>On February 2, 2022, Mike took to Instagram to clear himself of the incident. This came after fans' incessant messages asking him if he was responsible for Jaliyah's condition.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"that ain't got [expletive] to do with me," Mike said on the first of his two stories addressing the incident.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Further, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted</a> to having kept to himself the whole time, saying, "I ain't got nothin'&nbsp;to do with that." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He expressed his frustration at being texted about the matter in the next story.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>"Leave me the [expletive] alone," he said. He then asked people to have some sympathy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He was also annoyed people were bringing up a thing that was a week old at the time. Ending the clip, he revealed his girlfriend was not in jail anymore.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Jaliyah Unfazed by the Arrest</h2><p>Jaliyah was active on social media the day she got arrested. She had been flaunting her hair color and telling people she did not live for <a href=# rel=follow>social media</a> earlier that day.</p><p>And it seems like she was not that affected even after her reported arrest.</p><p>Mike's girlfriend was out of jail before January 31 and was back to tweeting about things she was excited about. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>That day, she sent out a tweet saying she was excited for her 2022 birthday. The mother of two celebrated her birthday on January 8.</p><p>She is also back on Instagram&nbsp;â€” her account had been inactive since August 2021. Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">latest post</a> could be hinting at her recent difficulty.</p><p>"When times are good, be grateful, and when times are tough, be graceful," she wrote on her February 2, 2022, post. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6lo7u6uciknGafmae5p77InqWdZZqWuarFwKFkmqujlsKtwI2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
