Elon recently became Twitter’s largest shareholder, with a 9.2 percent stake in the company. Because he owns the majority of the company, Elon now has the authority to make changes to the platform.</p><p>In fact, Elon suggested that people who wanted to subscribe to Twitter Blue should be able to pay for it with Dogecoin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Twitter-Blu-1.jpg><h2>What Is Twitter Blue?</h2><p>Twitter stated in a blog post that the new feature was designed to make the Twitter experience “more customized and expressive” by incorporating new features.</p><p>People who subscribed to the new feature were given access to a variety of features. To begin, these users can enjoy undoing tweets, bookmarking folders, and having a reading mode for a better user experience.</p><h2>How Much Does The Subscription Cost?</h2><p>According to the website, users will be able to enjoy these features for $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD per month. This feature is currently being tested for users in Canada and Australia.</p><p>It is unknown when other users will be able to take advantage of this. At the moment, only the features mentioned above will be provided. Additional features, however, are expected to be added in response to user feedback.</p><h2>Elon Musk Recommends The Dogecoin Payment Method</h2><p>Elon, who has been vocal about his interest in Dogecoin, suggested that payments for Twitter Blue be made in Dogecoin.</p><p>“Everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue (ie pays $3/month) should get an authentication checkmark,” he wrote in a series of tweets. Blue already has a modifiable 20-second time limit for editing tweets.’</p><p>“No advertisements,” he continued. If Twitter relies on advertising revenue to survive, corporations’ ability to dictate policy is greatly enhanced. Perhaps even the option to pay in Doge?”</p><p>As of now, no official confirmation of the changes has been issued. However, given Elon’s plans to introduce new terms to the platform, we wouldn’t be surprised if the Tesla CEO tries to shake things up.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOwoK2slad6o7jUnmSappRitbDDjKasnKBdnsButdOsZKytkqiws7XPraCopl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
