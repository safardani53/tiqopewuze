Alas, the ink remained … until now!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>When fans started to dissect images of the Fenty Beauty founder from earlier in the week, they noticed that the design appeared to have been covered up by a different tattoo. Her new ink resembles a crown.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>It’s no surprise that fans had some thoughts about the switch up, many taking to Twitter to share their thoughts. The general consensus? The revamped design has a little something to do with her new beau.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>A$AP, 32, and Rihanna have been linked for years, but they officially made their red carpet debut in December 2019. The rapper later called her “the love of my life” in 2021.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Whao. Rihanna covered her shark tattoo with Drake. She def moves on,” a fan said. Another Twitter user added: “Y’all Rihanna covered Drake’s shark tattoo and I am simply NOT okay.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Others are already anticipating the tattoo saga will find a place in Drake’s next album.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Rihanna-Covers-Up-Matching-Tattoo-With-Drake-From-2016-Inline-1.jpg><p class=p1>“If Rihanna covering her shark tattoo doesn’t get us sad drake back idk what will,” a music lover wrote. Someone else chimed in: “Drakes gonna have a song about Rihanna covering up their matching shark tattoo<span class=s1>👀</span><span class=s2>.”</span></p><p class=p4>While people that once shipped Drake and Rihanna are a bit distraught over the disappearing ink, others simply couldn’t stop obsessing over the Barbadian beauty’s adorable date night pictures with A$AP.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4>There was plenty of PDA-packed snaps from their outing at Barcade in New York City, but fashion-loving fans were obviously fawning over their unbelievable couple style.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p4>RiRi looked like an IRL Barbie, rocking a pink slip dress from Christian Dior. The showstopper however was hands-down her fuzzy pink bucket hat from Emma Brewin. She accessorized her look with Tom Ford python-print heels and a beaded Fendi bag.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4>A$AP, for his part, looked equally as stylish.
