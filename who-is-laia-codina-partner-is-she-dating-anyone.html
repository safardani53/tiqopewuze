Is She Dating Anyone?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Laia Codina doesn’t have a partner currently and seems to be single. The Spanish player hasn’t shared much about her romantic life on social media.</strong></p><p>The trusted player of Jorge Vilda’s Spanis side, Laia Codina, grew up on a farm in Campllong. Her father, Xevi Paneda, owns one of the biggest farms in Girona.</p><p>Recently, Codina, whose full name is Laia Codina Paneda, signed with the English team Arsenal. The center-back will make her way to England right after she stars in the historic World Cup finals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laia-codina-barcelona.jpg><p>With teammates <a href=# rel=noopener>Aitana Bonmati</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Cata Coll</a>, Laia Codina will come against Lionesses on Sunday. This is the first time both teams have reached the world cup finals.</p><p>Codina will also relish the opportunity to play against her new Arsenal teammate <a href=# rel=noopener>Alessia Russo</a>, who has scored three goals this tournament.&nbsp;</p><h2>Laia Codina Partner: Is She Dating Anyone?</h2><p>The Spanish defender, Laia Codina, doesn’t have a partner and appears single. The former Barcelona player hasn’t shared much about her romantic life on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Going through her Instagram handle, Laia has strictly kept her posts related to her on-field achievements. And if it isn’t a post about soccer, it’s bound to be a picture with her sister Mariona.</p><p>But previously, as a teenager, Laia used to date a guy named Marc Nierga, with whom she has shared a few pictures. In one of the snaps shared by Laia, the defender captioned the post, “Look at your side now we are two!.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laia-codina-partner.jpg><p>In 2017, she shared a <a href=# rel=noopener>mirror selfie</a> with Marc, captioning the post with the lyrics of the Chainsmoker hit, Don’t Let Me Down, the song which had gripped the entire world.&nbsp;</p><p>But since then, we haven’t seen much of Marc on Laia’s Instagram handle. Most of her posts are now centered around her Barcelona teammates and her family.</p><p>Having made her Barcelona debut in 2019, the young player was loaned out to AC Milan for a season in 2021. The teenage couple might have drifted apart after Laia began playing for the senior team.</p><p>But there could also be a chance that the Spanish defender now wants to keep her relationship lowkey and not show much of Marc on her Instagram handle.&nbsp;</p><h2>Laia Codina Parents, Núria, And Xevi Panedas</h2><p>Laia Codina’s parents Nuria, and Xevi Panedas, raised two girls in Campllong, Spain. The couple doesn’t come from athletic backgrounds but has supported their daughter’s soccer career.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuria Panedas has now traveled 75,000 km to watch her daughter represent their country in the World Cup. With her elder daughter, Mariona, Nuria had traveled to New Zealand to root for Spain in the group stages.&nbsp;</p><p>She then returned to Spain, but now she will travel again to Down Under to watch her daughter play the historic final.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with Diari de Girona, Nuria said she ran screaming in their home after receiving the news that the Federation would pay for their tickets. The mother-of-two said she has now used up her entire vacation days.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laia-codena-parents.jpg><p>But Nuria has no regret and said all the traveling was worth it and she would do it three or four times. One of her biggest supporters, Nuria, would be the one to take Laia to her training sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>Laia’s father, Xevi Panedas, owns a farm in Girona, Can Feliu, one of the largest in the city. Every day the farm produces 12 million liters of milk. Xevi opened the farm the same day, as Barca won the Europen Cup in 1992.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, Xevi said whenever Laia comes to the farm, the first thing she does is drink milk straight from the tank, unboiled. During his interview, Xevi revealed that Laia was first interested in skating. But as soon as she started playing soccer, there was no point turning around.&nbsp;</p><p>The interview happened before Spain reached the knockout stages. Xevi said he would arrive in New Zealand right when Spain played against Japan and stay until the quarterfinal.&nbsp;</p><p>But had already warned those around the farm that if the team reached further, he would continue to watch his daughter live from the stands.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdoa6qrYycpp2hnpZ6sa3RraWeql2ewG6%2Fx55knZmknruoecCnsKimlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
