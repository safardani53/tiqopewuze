Take a second to place your butt back in your chair, Shadowhunters fans, because the season 2B premiere on June 5 was a DOOZY, to say the least! But let’s start with the good stuff: Clary finally learned that Jace is NOT her brother! He’s been hiding this secret since the 2A finale, and planned to keep it a secret forever since he still loves her, but she seems so happy with Simon! However, Valentine outed him. When Clary learned, she was PISSED! She yelled at Jace for refusing to feel anything, to embrace his human side. Yikes! See pics of the show, here.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Meanwhile, they need to put that aside because there’s a lot going on. There’s a greater demon on the loose, who is searching for the cup. Luckily, nobody knows where it is so he hasn’t gotten it quite yet. Jace, Valentine, Clary, Alec and Magnus believe he might have Izzy for a while, so they summoned him. Unfortunately they way underestimated his strength! He nearly kills them, but Jace manages to activate his rune and fight him off just in time! Unfortunately it seems like the demon did something to Magnus, because he’s acting super weird.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Luckily, Izzy was never with the greater demon. She was wandering around trying to get a vampire to bite her to feed her Yin Fen addiction. That’s when she stumbles upon <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sebastian, a new and mysterious shadowhunter</a>. He claims to come from an Institute in London, but stayed in America to get over an addiction of his own. He offers to help her and let her stay with him, but he still seems a little sketchy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Luke is having some major problems of his own. His pack is furious that he<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> lead&nbsp;them into battle</a> and got so many of them killed. Some of them even left to start a new pack in Philly. Plus, his new partner is super suspicious of him. Meanwhile, Simon is having the time of his life being able to walk in the daylight again, but he realizes that he needs to hide this new power, or people will start asking questions, and Jace’s secret would be in jeopardy. Yikes! Tune in to Freeform on Mondays at 8/7c to see what happens next!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of the premiere?
