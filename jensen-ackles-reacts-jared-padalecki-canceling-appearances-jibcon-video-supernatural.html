He knows that this family is gonna miss him, and I told him, ‘Please, take care of yourself.’ We didn’t want him to exhaust himself anymore, so it’s good. As you know, he’s a big guy with a big heart, and he gives a lot of it out. He needed to get some rest, so keep him in your thoughts and send him some wishes.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Aw!
