I put it in the air fryer at 240 degrees.</p><p>“We're gonna cook it for about five minutes and then see what it looks.”</p><p>But Max soon had a realisation and remembered that he had forgotten to add ham, so he quickly removed the toastie from the air fryer and said: “Uh oh, I totally forgot to put the ham in, that would have been upsetting if it had finished without the ham.”&nbsp;</p><p>Once the ham was added, he put the toastie back in the air fryer.</p><p>Then, once the <a href=#>cooking</a> time was up, Max noted: “And we're done. Time to get it out of here.</p><p>“Look at this. Honestly, it's literally the best toastie that I've made.</p><p>“Lovely.”</p><p>Max’s clip has clearly impressed many, as it has quickly amassed 172,700 views.</p><p>It has 6,285 likes, 142 comments, 871 saves and 80 shares.</p><p>Social media users were left open-mouthed at the tasty snack and were eager to express this in the comments.</p><p>One person said: “Damn that looks so good.”</p><p>Another added: “That looks insane!”</p><p>A third commented: “That looks incredible.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, one food fan noted: “Wow, I definitely need to try this one Max.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Whilst someone else posted: “Totally making this for my lunch today but with bacon as I don't have any ham.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
