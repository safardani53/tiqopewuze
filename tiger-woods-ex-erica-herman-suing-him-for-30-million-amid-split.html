Her lawsuit was initially filed in October 2022.</p><p class=p1>Herman, who <a href=#>began dating the golfer in 2017</a>, noted in the court filing that she has lived at Woods’ residence since he purchased the Florida property and “performed valuable services at the request of [Tiger’s] agents,” which was part of an “oral tenancy agreement” that allowed her to live there. Herman further alleged that Woods had engaged in premeditated “prohibited practices” to get her to leave the mansion upon their recent split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tiger-Woods-Ex-Erica-Herman-Suing-Athlete-for-30-Million-Claims-He-Tricked-Her-Into-Moving-Out-450.jpg><p class=p1>“Specifically, by&nbsp;trickery, agents of&nbsp;[Woods] convinced [Herman] to pack&nbsp;a&nbsp;suitcase for&nbsp;a&nbsp;short&nbsp;vacation and,&nbsp;when&nbsp;she arrived&nbsp;at the airport,&nbsp;they<a href=#>&nbsp;told her&nbsp;she&nbsp;had&nbsp;been locked&nbsp;out of&nbsp;her residence</a>,&nbsp;in&nbsp;violation&nbsp;of the&nbsp;oral&nbsp;tenancy&nbsp;agreement and&nbsp;in&nbsp;violation of Florida&nbsp;law,” the court documents read. “They&nbsp;then informed her&nbsp;she was not&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;her Residence and,&nbsp;without&nbsp;legal counsel to&nbsp;aid&nbsp;in her in&nbsp;this emotional&nbsp;moment,&nbsp;they&nbsp;utilized&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer&nbsp;to confront&nbsp;her&nbsp;with&nbsp;proposals&nbsp;to resolve&nbsp;the wrongdoing&nbsp;they&nbsp;were&nbsp;in the midst of&nbsp;committing.”</p><p class=p1>Herman also claimed that their oral agreement had been breached when Woods’ “agents” locked her out of the home, removed her personal belongings and told her she could not return. She also alleged that more than $40,000 in cash that belonged to her was misappropriated.</p><p class=p1>The Masters Tournament champ — who <a href=#>shares two children</a> with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Elin Nordegren</strong></a> — has not publicly addressed the lawsuit, which was filed late last year. Herman is seeking actual and consequential damages based on the rental value of the property. Woods’ trust has since filed their own motion to dismiss Herman’s petition.</p><p class=p1>Neither Woods nor Herman publicly announced when they ended their romantic relationship, though the former restaurant manager has also <a href=#>filed to nullify the non-disclosure agreement that Woods had her sign</a> at the beginning of their romance. According to the court docs that&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>obtained on Wednesday, March 8, Herman is asking for clarification about “various legal claims she&nbsp;believes she has” regarding the end of their relationship.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The PGA Championship winner and Herman first debuted their romance in November 2017, with the Florida native frequently supporting Woods at his athletic games. Nearly four years later, Herman was a pillar of support after Woods<a href=#> suffered severe leg injuries in a February 2021 car crash</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Erica dropped everything to be with Tiger the moment she heard what happened,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that March</a>. “She’s been by his bedside, holding his hand and telling him everything’s going to be OK. He’s a champ and he’s got this. … She’s been so compassionate and supportive — all his friends and family have. He couldn’t have asked for more in that regard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZeav27DzqibrGWVrXqmvsicmGaglae6orqMrKyippditaq5jJ%2Bmq2VjZXqutculoKimXZa6qrCMrKeloaRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
