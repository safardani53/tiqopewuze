The <a href=#>"GRWM"</a> queen has a cult-like following and never fails to leave the house looking nothing less but flawless.</p><p>In early 2023, Alix began posting TikToks with one of her friends from school, junior Topher Griffin (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@tophgriff</a>). Clearly, these two were tight — she even created a segment dubbed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Tea Time with Topher"</a> with him. It wasn't too long before Alix's fans quickly hit the follow button on Topher's page.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But as of late, fans have noticed that Alix and Topher are no longer posting videos together anymore. What happened? We unpack their drama below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alix Earle and Topher allegedly had a friend breakup during the Tarte influencer trip.</h2><p>As TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@pamelawurstvetrini</a> infers below, things are believed to have gone awry during the latest <a href=#>Tarte influencer trip</a> to Turks and Caicos.</p><p>You see, this was a super exclusive trip. And Alix, being the good friend she is, picked Topher as her plus-one on the trip. He seemed super excited. But weirdly enough, we didn't see too many photos of them together.</p><p>"Here's the problem with picking Topher as your plus one," @pamelawurstvetrini said in her video. "He doesn't have plus one energy. He has main character energy."</p><p>Basically, the two are believed to have gotten into some kind of riff. What exactly happened is unknown but they went in as besties and left — after days of endless alcohol and partying — seeming very distant.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>When they returned home, Alix began crying while on TikTok live, but didn't share any details as to what happened.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>So, that's what we know so far. And already it seems like Alix's fans have turned their backs on Topher. But as creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@alyssadiamonds</a> said in her TikTok below, we shouldn't start making up our own narratives on what happened. "You all decided from watching a few 15/30 second videos that you don't like him anymore when you were hyping him up like 30 seconds ago," she said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ultimately, she called other users out for making fan edits to videos of Topher and attacking him on the platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmqxIyemKuklWKur7CMraapoJWneqW%2BwKaYZp2opbmitc2emw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
