Not a single pizza on it was below 780 calories, unless you count the one without cheese (which I do not).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000019795425.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Obviously I was not deterred. (No one really thinks pizza is a health food.) But seeing the calorie counts in black and white certainly left a nasty taste.</p><p>Eating out is meant to be a treat, not a reason to feel bad about yourself.</p><p>I’m no calorie-counter. But even so, some of the joy was replaced by guilt.</p><p>And it made me worry about those for whom eating is rarely a carefree experience. There are 1.25million men and women with eating disorders.</p><p>Many of those in recovery say that until now, restaurants were a rare place of escape from an obsession with calories. Not any more.</p><p>According to the eating disorder charity Beat, 93 per cent of current or former sufferers said putting calories on menus would negatively impact them.</p><p>And there is little evidence to suggest the move reduces obesity generally.</p><p>People who really should be monitoring their calorie intake will ignore the new numbers but those who would love to ignore them will not be able to.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice to take this ghastly conundrum off the table for good?</p><h3 class=has-text-align-center id=no-says-oliver-harvey>No, says Oliver Harvey</h3><p>AFTER a decent cooked brekkie, I had wandered to my South London local to be confronted by the new-fangled horror of menus with calories.</p><p>“Elf’n’safety” and its tragic twin “wellbeing” had struck again. I thought: “No thanks. None of your business what I eat.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000457473947.jpg><p>Then I scrolled down the menu at the gut-bloating calorific content of the Sunday roasts on offer.</p><p>Roast pork belly? More than 2,600 calories. Roast beef? Nearly 2,000 calories.</p><p>Even the vegan Wellington was almost 1,800 calories. The NHS reckons a bloke should eat around 2,500 calories a day.</p><p>What with the brekkie, the cider I was quaffing and the red wine I was eyeing — plus the evening toastie I would need to soak all that up — I would be lucky to keep under double that figure if I had a roast.</p><p>Further down the menu was the baked potato gnocchi which, last week, I would not have looked twice at. Even with an added side portion of broccoli, that came in at a full 1,000 calories less than even the vegan roast.</p><p>So I went for it. On its bed of spring greens and toasted sesame, the gnocchi went very well with a glass of montepulciano.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It even left enough in my calorie locker to raise a second glass to those wise folk from wellbeing land.</p><p>I thought the calorie count would ruin my night.
