The ABC comedy show was based on the real-life story of series creator Adam F. Goldberg’s loving family, as he grew up in the Reagan era.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Orrantia is more than just an actor!&nbsp;She is a singer and songwriter, who was a contestant in season one of&nbsp;The X Factor&nbsp;(USA). As a&nbsp;talented&nbsp;lyricist, Orrantia wrote the theme song for&nbsp;The Janee Show&nbsp;and co-wrote ‘Power of a Girl’ for the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts USA.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2019, she released her EP ‘The Way Out,’ which <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">details </a>her pain following the end of a deceitful relationship and the pain that followed. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>The Betrayal</h2><p>After being heartbroken by the man she loved, Orrantia began writing about her painful experience to heal herself. The first single released, ‘If I Don’t,’ had the Texas native singing about denial.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The man in question was a former marine paralympian, Brandon Pelletier, whom she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a>&nbsp;on the sets of&nbsp;The Goldbergs&nbsp;in 2015. He was part of a tour group for the wounded veterans. After their initial meeting, the pair kept in touch over Instagram, where Pelletier sent her friendly messages frequently, especially on Valentine’s Day or New Year’s Eve.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They are both from Texas, but work took Orrantia to Los Angeles, so they began their long-distance <a href=# rel=follow>relationship</a>. The actress fell deeply in love, and after dating for a year, he moved in with her in Nashville. Their relationship was going great until she received a call from her bank telling her that there had been suspicious activities on her credit card.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>At first, Pelletier denied it, and their relationship continued, but a few months later, she received another call from the bank. This time she was convinced that&nbsp;Pelletier had stolen almost $9000 from her credit card through fraudulent transactions and bank withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actress </a>was heartbroken, and she reported it to the police.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It was heartbreaking. I thought we were going to get married one day.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p>Though the singer had to go through the pain of betrayal, she successfully&nbsp;made it to the other side of the healing process. The actress is currently in a relationship with Greg Furman. Furman is also an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actor</a> who has starred in Flight 666, Nazi Overlord, The Last Keepers, Triassic World,&nbsp;and others.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Although the couple is tight-lipped about the details of their relationship, they display their affection for each other on social media. As per Orrantia’s Instagram post, it seems the couple has been in a romantic relationship since 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides acting, the couple also love music. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Her Campus, the actress talked about how her boyfriend taught her to venture into different music genres like indie music and future collaborations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>We are hoping to collaborate on some things soon. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;very excited about that.</p><p>You can catch Orrantia on the season finale of&nbsp;The Goldbergs, which will premiere on October 2021 on ABC.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmJa5psWMqKmrmZ6ptqJ5w5qroqaXYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
