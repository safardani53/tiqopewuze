It was very unexpected as last week he had CSF drawn from his shunts and they adjusted the valve setting of his shunt and he was doing much better,” she wrote&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>via Instagram alongside a photo of her son. “We were still struggling with his diarrhea and I was giving him potassium 3 times a day because it was dropping so low. His heart stopped here at home and I performed chest compressions to get it going until the paramedics arrived and took over. When he left for the hospital he looked good and was breathing on his own but his heart gave out again at the hospital.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Arroyo said that she doesn’t “have all the answers now,” she shared that Grayson had been dealing with “fevers, infection and low potassium” for the last few months and that “most likely took a toll on my sweet boys heart.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>She continued, “I’m still in shock and going through the motions of dealing with all the details. I know Gray is playing cards with Gramma and playing Trouble with our beloved Diane.
