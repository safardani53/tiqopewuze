Although <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Eubanks</a> has often been the glue for the very animated cast of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Southern Charm</a>, the real estate agent has had her own battles to work through while on the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When fans first met Eubanks, she was very adamant about not wanting children. Even though she was firm about her stance, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she worried that her husband might resent her</a> if they never had kids, or worse — her kids might take after her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eubanks told PEOPLE in 2019 that despite the difficult parts of parenting, it's worth the "love you cannot describe" when a child enters your life. However, the star has said she's done after having one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I can either give [Palmer] a sibling or I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>can give her a sane mother</a>," said Eubanks. "And I think giving her a happy, healthy, mentally sane mother is way more important than a brother or sister that she's probably gonna fight with anyway."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadly for fans, Eubanks made a shocking announcement in May 2020 revealing that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she wouldn't be returning for the show's seventh season</a>. She dropped the news subtly in the comments section of one of her own posts on Instagram but then had to formally address her exit when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>"insidious rumors" about her marriage began to swirl</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My decision was made and given to Bravo months ago and had absolutely nothing to do with ridiculous and fake rumors about my marriage," Eubanks said in a since-deleted Instagram post. "Please disregard any fabricated rumor. It's a ploy for ratings and that's it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before that statement, AllAboutTheTea.com had alleged that Wimberly <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener nofollow">had been having a two-year affair behind Eubanks' back</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The outlet reported its source claimed Eubanks "was handling it privately off camera" and was "devastated" when she found out producers were plotting to bring up the allegation during the season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eubanks <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>denied</a> that the allegations were her reason for leaving the series.

From losing his passion for law to figuring out how to make his love of sewing into a career, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Conover</a> experienced many growing pains and endured a lot of teasing from his castmates. Additionally, his three-year relationship with Naomie Olindo crumbled, which prompted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>his first experience with depression</a>. When Olindo went public with her new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>boyfriend Metul Shah</a>, Conover found his own way to start fresh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Whitney Sudler-Smith introduced him to Bimini, an island that is part of the Bahamas, he fell in love and spent a few months there to relax and reevaluate his life, only to return to Charleston as a happier man. He even launched his own sewing lifestyle brand called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sewing Down South</a>!

"In the past, I was mocked for enjoying the art and craft of sewing, but now — I'm excited to focus on what brings me and so many others so much joy. Us sewers deserve a kick-ass sewing brand that represents our lifestyle!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, Conover began dating his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Winter House</a> costar, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Paige DeSorbo</a>.

The fiery redhead burst onto the scene as Charleston's "It Girl," who everyone had their eyes on. It wasn't until she started dating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>disgraced politician Thomas Ravenel</a> that things got heated. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>toxic relationship</a> put both Dennis and Ravenel in a downward spiral that eventually ended but took years to repair. The two (and probably only) highlights of their love affair are their adorable children: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kensington and Saint</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dennis' rise from the ashes took several seasons, and many of the people who turned their backs on her have come around, including the queen of Charleston herself, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Patricia Altschul</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were listening to one side of the equation and it was very believable at the time," Altschul said during the season 6 premiere about how Ravenel would talk about Dennis and her past behavior. "There were a lot of things that converged to change my opinion. I had my own altercation with Thomas and I found out that he can be into character assassination. It made me rethink everything he had ever told me about Kathryn."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, Dennis began dating Chleb Ravenell. After a breakup, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rekindled their relationship</a> in 2022, though Dennis said <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>"something's off"</a> about the reunion. She has since <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>focused on raising her two children</a> and confirmed that she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>left the series</a> in January 2023, after eight seasons.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-thomas-ravenel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Thomas Ravenel</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former state treasurer of South Carolina seemed to have it all — good looks, money, power — until everything fell apart. Throughout each season, fans have watched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ravenel</a> slowly unravel throughout his dysfunctional relationship with ex Kathryn Dennis, but things only got worse when he started dating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ashley Jacobs</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The registered nurse caused so much drama that she decided to publicly apologize to all Southern Charm fans and Dennis in a since-deleted Instagram post. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ravenel and Jacobs eventually split for good</a> after more than a year of dating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ravenel left the show ahead of season 6, following another rough patch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2018, Dennis filed documents in Charleston seeking to obtain primary custody of their two children after their former nanny accused Ravenel of rape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ravenel was arrested and pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and battery. He agreed to pay a $500 fine in lieu of a 30-day jail sentence. Ravenel and the nanny reached a $125,000 settlement in October, with Ravenel agreeing to pay $45,000 in her personal legal fees and an additional $80,000 to a local nonprofit aiding adult survivors of sexual assault.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a lengthy custody battle, Dennis and Ravenel agreed to share joint legal and physical custody of their two children in November 2019, with Ravenel having "primary legal custody," his lawyer told PEOPLE at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By February 2020, the two were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spotted spending time together again</a> but denied being a couple.

Although he's been open about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fearing lifelong bachelorhood</a>, the wealthy Casanova did make a solid attempt to find love on his spin-off reality dating show called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>RelationShep</a>, which premiered in December 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rose enlisted friends, like Cameran Eubanks, to take his search outside of Charleston, in cities like L.A., Dallas, Austin and N.Y.C. The season finale revealed that Rose ended up choosing Bella Clark, but she eventually <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ended the relationship</a>, sending Rose back into the dating pool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Rose began dating <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Ann Green</a>. The relationship <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ended two years later</a>, with a source telling PEOPLE, "Shep has a real issue with monogamy and refused to commit to Taylor, telling her that he doesn't want to be with just one person and change his lifestyle."

Whispers of the possible dalliance surfaced at Sudler-Smith's mother Patricia Altschul's dinner party during the season's premiere. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dennis later admitted it was true</a> while talking to friends at Chelsea Meissner's housewarming party.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I swore to him [I wouldn't tell]," she said before confirming it happened while they were both in L.A.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the juicy gossip, the two remained friends and Sudler-Smith took more of a role behind the camera than in front. That is, until 2022, when it was revealed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sudler-Smith kissed and "spent the night" with cast member Naomie Olindo</a> after the "dog wedding" of Altschul and Rose's dogs, Peaches and Little Craig. Naturally, the encounter caused all sorts of drama with the stars of Southern Charm, with Conover accusing Sudler-Smith of breaking the "bro code."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-naomie-olindo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Naomie Olindo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although she was first introduced during season 3 as Conover's girlfriend, Olindo has become a star in her own right. Her unfiltered approach may have added more fuel to the fire as their relationship decayed, but their split was for the best because she moved on to Charleston-based physician Metul Shah. Early into season 6, Eubanks gushed about how hot Shah is on the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is probably the finest man I've ever seen in real life," Eubanks told the cameras.

However, her departure was brief. After sitting out of season 7, Olindo returned to the series for season 8. In the interim, Olindo and Shah <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>split up</a> in July 2021.

The star denied the accusation but LeCroy still believes he cheated. In a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>now-viral video released in 2018</a>, Kroll and LeCroy are seen having an explosive argument after she finds Kroll in his underwear with two other women in his home.
