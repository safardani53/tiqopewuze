The couple was seated in a box alongside rapper <a href=#><strong>Daddy Yankee</strong></a> to cheer on Puerto Rico in their match against the Dominican Republic.</p><p>“They were super cute together, especially with her baby bump,” a source tells Us Weekly. At one point, Marc took his affection away from Nadia to blow kisses to <strong>Luis Fonsi</strong>, who was a couple rows away. Marc and Nadia were also put on the big screen which had the stadium of 35,000 erupt in cheer.”</p><p>In addition to arriving early, the couple were “high-fiving fans” and stayed “up to the very end of the game,” the onlooker notes. “The two stayed close together and were definitely cozied up <a href=#>while watching the game</a>. He was very protective of her the whole night and had his arm around her.”</p><p>At the game, Anthony and Daddy Yankee also stopped to snap a pic with Marlins player <strong>Jazz Chisholm</strong> and former <a href=#>New York Yankees</a> catcher <a href=#><strong>Jorge Posada</strong></a>.</p><p>The pair’s latest outing comes one month after Ferreira <a href=#>debuted her baby bump</a> on the 2023 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards red carpet alongside her husband on February 23. Earlier that month, she announced that she and the Grammy winner were <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a> via Instagram. (Anthony is already a <a href=#>father to six children</a>. He shares daughter Ariana, 29, and son Chase, 28, with ex-girlfriend <strong>Debbie Rosado</strong>, sons Cristian, 23, and Ryan, 19, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Dayanara Torres</strong></a>, and <a href=#>twins Emme and Max</a>, 15, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>.)</p><p>“Best Valentine’s Gift Ever!!!” the former Miss Universe Paraguay winner captioned a pic of her and Anthony’s <a href=#>hands on her baby bump</a> on February 14. “Gracias Dios por esta bendición tan grande en nuestras vidas.”</p><p>The duo confirmed their romance in March 2022, one month before the “I Need You” singer’s ex-wife Lopez, 53 — to whom he was married from 2004 to 2014 — <a href=#>got engaged</a> to her now-husband <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a> for the second time.</p><p>After nearly three months of dating, Anthony <a href=#>popped the question</a> in May 2022. “Engagement partyyyyy!!!” the Paraguay native captioned an Instagram Story pic of her ring at the time.”</p><p>She showed off her diamond in <a href=#>another Instagram post</a> that same month. “Kicking off birthday week,” she captioned photos of her and the “You Sang to Me” singer posing on a private plane with a birthday cake and champagne glasses.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Less than one year later, they <a href=#>tied the knot on January 23</a> in a ceremony held at Miami’s Perez Art Museum. For her nuptials, Ferreira donned a long-sleeved ballgown with floral decals, which Anthony complemented with a simple, black suit. Among the wedding’s celebrity attendees were Fonsi, 44, <a href=#><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>David</strong></a> and <a href=#>Cruz Beckham</a> and <a href=#><strong>Maluma</strong></a>.</p><p>Scroll below to see pics from Anthony and Ferreira’s MLB date night:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktq%2B%2FyJ2cZqWRp7Burc2tn6imqWKur7CMqamen56Wu7V51qKdnmWelrGqrdJmpKWaXZmutbGMp6CgoKRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
