The Victoria’s Secret model hit the beach in a two-piece, which included intricate straps across her midsection, on Dec. 30. She danced around in the sand, with her tanned skin glowing in the sunlight. At one point, she turned around to show off the skimpy backside of the bathing suit, and she had a huge smile on her face the entire time. Her energy is truly infectious!</p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong><strong>Olivia Munn</strong></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>For her pre-New Year’s Eve swimsuit pic,&nbsp;<strong>Olivia Munn</strong> wore bikini bottoms and a tiny white crop top.
