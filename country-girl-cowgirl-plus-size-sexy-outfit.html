She said the lookbook represented "how the plus-size cowgirl industry wants us to dress."</p><p>Each of the photos featured a plus-size woman wearing a combination of baggy tops, straight-leg jeans, and muted denim tones.</p><p>Then, the clip cut to a rapid-fire series of Letty's selfies and posed photos.
