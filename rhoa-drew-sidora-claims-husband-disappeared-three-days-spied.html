And we're arguing about things in year six that we argued about like, year one."</p><p>However, Ralph revealed to <a href=#>Mike Hill</a> as the two spent some time together during Cynthia's get-together with the <a href=#>ladies</a> that he's had to "just get out and just go" following the <a href=#>Covid-19</a> lockdown and Drew's mother crashing at their place during the pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625671021.jpg><p>At the same party, Drew revealed to the ladies that she and her husband have considered divorce multiple times.</p><p>She told them: "I've divorced my husband like, every other day. My husband will say we're getting a divorce.</p><p>"Like we've said, 'Okay, we're going to get our own places, we're going to get lawyers.' I'm telling you for real, last week he left and didn't tell me where he was."</p><p>She continued: "He was gone for like, three days. My husband is a runner, so he likes to go and he doesn't want to answer anybody."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625671026.jpg><p>The actress then explained in a confessional that she and Ralph "got into a huge argument," and that he "was at a breaking point for sure."</p><p>She continued: "So he went to his office, you know, to cool off, and later that night when I went to check on him, he was gone. And I didn't see him for three days."</p><p>Things reached an all-time high between Drew and Ralph as they continued to celebrate their anniversary with a chef-cooked meal at home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625671018.jpg><p>"I feel like that's just not a part of the marriage," Drew told him when he asked what she thought wasn't working between them.</p><p>"You don't ever put that ingredient, like, in the marriage. â€¦ You feel comfortable just leaving and not telling me that you're leaving. That's one major issue. I'd like to see that change.</p><p>"When you go for a trip, do you feel like it's important to tell your wife that you're leaving, A?" she asked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625671025.jpg><p>"And B, that you're going for days and where you were? Because you left the other day and I still don't know where you were."</p><p>The new housewife continued: "You left and I didn't know where you were. You didn't take my phone calls, you didn't talk to me, you didn't text me back unless it was about the house or about business."</p><p>Ralph hit back, saying: "Go check your text messages and not one single text message went without being returned in one minute."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000625671022.jpg><p>However, he refused to tell her where he had been exactly, aside from saying he was at the beach, as it would have not been beneficial to their relationship.</p><p>He then admitted that he had left Georgia, which shocked Drew even more.</p><p>She told him: "If there's an emergency, or anything that happens, I should know where my husband is. We all thought you were downstairs. I got you dinner, I'm banging on the door. How do I not know my husband left the house?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000597233892.jpg><p>Finally, Ralph broke and told her he had been in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>But Drew's questions weren't done when she dropped a major bomb, asking him: "You have a camera in the house that watches us? Were you watching us when you were gone?"</p><p>Ralph admitted that he had "cameras everywhere" but that he hadn't seen the footage from the days he had been gone.</p><p>She told him: "You were watching us in the family room. Me and my mom and the kids. I didn't know there was a camera there, and I saw the camera and you were watching us. So now you're lying to me, that's what we're doing? That's crazy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000597233746.jpg><p>The mother of three then admitted that Ralph has "always been 'big brother.'</p><p>"He's into this technology. I found a picture in his phone where I was sleeping, my mom was sitting on the couch and my kids were in the background. It's just too much. Like, that's disrespectful. It's an invasion of privacy. And I am so hurt."</p><p>"So you knew where I was, but I didn't know where you were," said Drew. "You see how lopsided that is?"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Their conversation ended in a huge fight with Drew walking away angrily and telling her mom repeatedly that she was done with their marriage and expressing her frustration that he couldn't make her understand her side.</p><p>Drew and Ralph got married after meeting during a press tour for one of her movies.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Within nine months of meeting, the couple was married.</p><p>They share two children together while Drew has a son from a previous relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpaWuFc3yUaKmhp5FisbOx1maqopyfp65ur8uaoKarXZ3CtK7Ap5tmnJmorrG8xJqpnpxdqbWzscRmm5qxo2LAsbXEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
