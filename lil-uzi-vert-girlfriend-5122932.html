Fans are clamoring for the 4-1-1 on their&nbsp; romantic endeavors. Learn more about <strong>JT</strong>, the girlfriend of Lil Uzi, below.</p><h2>JT Is One Half Of City Girls Rap Group</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Born <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jatavia Shakara Johnson</strong> </a>in December 1992, JT would link up with<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Yung Miami</strong> </a>around 2017 to form City Girls. The name derived from their home towns of Opa-locka and Liberty City, described by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Complex</a> magazine as “two of the roughest neighborhoods in Miami, Florida”. Their first single was “F*** Dat N****”, a diss track. Soon they had a&nbsp;guest appearance on&nbsp;<strong>Drake’s</strong> chart-topping single “In My Feelings” in 2018 and the rest is history!</p><h2>She Went To Prison For Fraud</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Just as the City Girls were coming up on the charts, JT was sent away to the big house. Shortly after the release of “F*** Dat N****”, she was arrested and charged with aggravated identity theft, and was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison. JT began her prison term in July 2018 and was released on March 1, 2020. While JT was incarcerated, Yung Miami continued to promote the group’s music and as soon as JT landed home, they recorded a song called “First Day Out,” which saw JT freestyling over a beat produced by <strong>Twysted Genius</strong>.</p><h2>JT Is A Mental Health Advocate</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In March 2023, JT <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> about checking in on her mental health. “Super excited about starting therapy, I encourage you all to do the same! 🤞🏾.” And she got tons of support from fans! “omg not advocating for mental health resources!!!! WE NEED MORE BLACK CELEBS HAVING THIS CONVO! hope you keep us updated with your journey it’ll mean a lot,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted</a> one excited follower.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Lil Uzi was just as supportive, as they said “JT’s move is entirely positive” and that they wants fans to “love and embrace themselves,” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><h2>The Couple Love To Gift Each Other Luxury Whips</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Back in January 2022, Lil Uzi went above and beyond for a little birthday treat for their lady. Soon after JT had shocked fans by posting about being single, the couple made up, with the rapper gifting her a Rolls-Royce Cullinan. A few months prior, JT blessed Uzi with a Mercedes-Benz V-Class and a BMW G 310 R Sport motorcycle for their birthday!</p><h2>JT Says She’s Inspired By Lil Uzi</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>If luxury cars don’t say enough about their love for each other, JT also is not at a loss for words when it comes to gushing about her beau. “He’s a great man,” the City Girls star told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Angie Martinez</a>. “No matter how the internet tries to paint Uzi. Uzi is a great man! He’s so inspiring. No matter what he’s going through, he’s going to work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uio2atqp56t7HRrWSgoaKhs7O1xKebZm1hZ396f5Fo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
