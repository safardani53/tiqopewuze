Amid rumors of infidelity, abandonment, and more, Erica filed for divorce from Safaree in May 2021. But, it looks like things are going to get worse before they can get better.</p><p>Just days after giving birth to the couple’s second child in late June 2021, Erica alleged that Safaree has been seeing model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaylin Garcia</a>. While Safaree has remained mum on the topic, Kaylin immediately took to social media to say her piece. Now, fans have become interested in the model’s dating life.
