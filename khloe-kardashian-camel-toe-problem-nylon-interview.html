In a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new interview with Nylon</a>, Khloe admitted the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to her in an exercise class.&nbsp;“I have a camel toe problem— Kamille, Kamille with a K. Now that I have lost weight, I swear my puss has lost weight too, which I did not know was an option but thank god. So she doesn’t care to be seen much these days but at the time she was a problem.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Khloe embraced Kamille, her sister wasn’t cool with it and urged her to try to hide it. “My sister <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kourtney</a></strong> did not appreciate that,” explained the beauty. “So she bought me these things, they’re almost like a maxi pad. I don’t know what they’re called, but it’s to hide your camel toe.” Unfortunately, these mystical devices caused more problems than solutions!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>[jwplatform ngSlEKa4]</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“It was falling out of my pants, and it was slipping,” said Khloe. “I was so uncomfortable I had to run. There’s this trampoline workout place called like Sky High in LA. We were doing this workout and I was like this is the worst time to be wearing this thing while I’m jumping up and down. So I had to remove it. I just said, ‘Kamille’s here. She’s at the class too. Get over it.’” We would have loved to see Kourt’s face! You do you, Khlo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> – would you try the camel toe device Khloe is talking about?
