In photos, seen below, the two can be seen indulging in conversation as they picked at their food. Dylan dressed cool and casual in a white t-shirt and baseball cap, while Chloe rocked cropped jeans and an oversized t-shirt. Witnesses claimed that the two were giving off “more than a friendly vibe” on the lunch date, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dylan-o-brien-chloe-bennet-dating-photos-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the past, Dylan has kept his love life very much out of the public eye. Although he never publicly discussed the relationship, it was reported that he dated his co-star from 2012’s&nbsp;The First Time,&nbsp;<strong>Britt Robertson</strong>, for several years. Aside from that he has had no public relationships. Meanwhile, Chloe has been linked to actors&nbsp;<strong>Sam Palladio</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Austin Nichols</strong>. She also dated&nbsp;<strong>Logan Paul</strong> in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dylan-o-brien-chloe-bennet-dating-photos-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Aside from his roles in huge movies and films, like&nbsp;The Maze Runner and&nbsp;Teen Wolf, Dylan also made big headlines at the end of 2021 when he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>starred in the short film</a> for&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift’s</strong></a> song “All Too Well.” Dylan and&nbsp;<strong>Sadie Sink</strong> played love interests in the film, and were on-hand to help Taylor promote it at a live premiere in November. Dylan and Sadie also showed up to Taylor’s special talk about the film at the Tribeca Film Festival in June.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After working with Taylor, who directed the short film, Dylan had nothing but praise for the singer. “After we did just one take of the kitchen scene, she came over and she was like, ‘This is it, I’m going to use this dialogue. We’re going to let this play. You’re right in the pocket. Let’s just do it again.’ And that is such a testament to her instincts as a director, which I found super impressive. She’s so confident in what she wants, and she comes in really prepped.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49qZp2xnJa7brvBq6Cepl2Yta27xGaZnqaemsFuuNSnmqFllJbBpnnPoaatp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
