We’re both civil and cause no drama because our son’s mental health is [our] top priority.”</p><p>Frend and Koshimbetova, who met while she was visiting the United States in 2017, found out they were expecting their first child together after a few months of dating. They welcomed a son, Richie, in April 2018, who was born in her native country of Russia. Eventually, the family received visas to come to the U.S. and moved to Maryland. The former couple <a href=#>married in August 2019</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/90-Day-Fiance-Steven-Frend-and-Olga-Koshimbetova-Split-After-1-Year-of-Marriage-2.jpg><p>“(P.S. Don’t assume you know the full story from this one little post),” the Maryland native added via his Instagram, before later deleting all photos of his estranged wife from his account.</p><p>Although the Russia native, 22, has not spoken out about the split, she shared a quote via her Instagram Story on Sunday, October 11. “So be kind, because <a href=#>life is hard enough</a> and everyone is fighting their own invisible battle,” the statement read.</p><p>Last month, she opened up about going to California with her son — but not with her husband, causing many to speculate about the status of their relationship.</p><p>“Where is Steven? Where did you go? Why did you go alone ? And many many others questions I received when I told that I’m going to California. For those who didn’t know, I have a family here,” <a href=#>she wrote via Instagram</a> on September 22. “My uncle came here 23 years ago, alone, without perfect English, without friends but after all these years they have a big family which included friends and other relatives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/90-Day-Fiance-Steven-Frend-and-Olga-Koshimbetova-Split-After-1-Year-of-Marriage-3.jpg><p>She continued: “As you remembered, I planned to visit them in August but then wildfires happened and I canceled my trip. But after a few weeks my uncle invited me again and i was so excited because I couldn’t spent more days sitting at home. After a car crash we literally stuck at home and unfortunately there are no Uber with a car seat and no bus for us.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the end, she explained why Frend didn’t travel with her. “And another reason: why it was a good idea to go alone without Steven, because we finally started to miss each other,” Koshimbetova wrote, adding the crying laughing emoji. “Spending 24/7 with each other can be really tough. Did ever go somewhere without your partner? Or do you always together?”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHq0wMSvnKdln6G0onnSqaOirF2Ws7Wx0WZoZrGVlr9uu8VmpJqqop6uqLGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
