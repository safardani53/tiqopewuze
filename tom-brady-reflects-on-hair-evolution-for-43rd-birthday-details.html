The NFL superstar took to Twitter on Monday, August 3 — his 43rd birthday! — to share an illustrated graphic spotlighting some of his most memorable ‘dos of all time.</p><p>It’s unclear who created the detailed illustration, but it’s evident that whoever did so is a Brady expert.

For example, when Brady was 23, his do was obviously inspired by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a> and&nbsp;and at 30, he rocked long locks reminiscent of a “Caveman.”</p><p>“Of all the haircuts throughout the years, my favorite one…is the next one!” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he tweeted</a> with the graphic. “Thank you all for the bday wishes!!”</p><p>Brady’s followers couldn’t help but weigh in on his hair evolution. “Bring back the caveman haha add a beard too it too bro,” one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user</a> wrote. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another tweeted</a>, “You make the haircut, not vice versa, lol.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tom-Brady-Birthday-Hairstyles-Promo.jpg><p>Many social media-goers were less interested in the hairstyles and more outspoken about his recent decision to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> following his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New England Patriots exit</a>. The athlete took to social media to share the news with his fans on March 20.</p><p>“Excited, humble and hungry …if there is one thing I have learned about football, it’s that nobody cares what you did last year or the year before that…you earn the trust and respect of those around through your commitment every single day,” Brady wrote in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> announcing the news.</p><p>He continued, “I’m starting a new football journey and thankful for the @buccaneers for giving me an opportunity to do what I love to do. I look forward to meeting all my new teammates and coaches and proving to them that they can believe and trust in me…I have always believed that well done is better than well said, so I’m not gonna say much more – I’m just gonna get to work!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m8rnnBq5idsV2nsqe4xJyrrGWfo3qprcirZJ6un6HCtbXOp2Sfp6JigXS%2Bw2aZoqqknbGixYydnK2ZmaHAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
