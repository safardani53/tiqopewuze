It was one of those nights that I, you know, often don’t get invited to.”</p><p>After admitting that she enjoys a bit of harmless snooping, Sedgwick noted that she’d let her curiosity get the best of her at the 58-year-old Top Gun actor’s home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kyra-Sedgwick-Says-She-Didnt-Get-Invited-Back-to-Tom-Cruises-Home-After-This-Incident%E2%80%A8.jpg><p>“There was this, like, fireplace mantle, and I was looking around and there was this little button underneath the mantle,” she continued. “I was like, ‘Oh, what is that little button?’ So I pressed the little button because I thought maybe something interesting would happen. Nothing happened … and then I got a little nervous.”</p><p>The Call Your Mother actress interrupted the New York native mid-conversation to let him know what she’d done. He responded that the button she’d pressed was strictly for emergencies.</p><p>“The cops came. … I think there were more than, like, five cop cars,” Sedgwick recalled. “It was something. I didn’t get invited back.”</p><p>The actress is no stranger to uncomfortable situations. In March, Bacon, 62, revealed during an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live that he’d given his wife a <a href=#>“frighteningly dangerous” bikini wax</a> during the COVID-19 quarantine.</p><p>“I’m one of those people that is cocky enough to think that I can probably do anything. You know what I mean? Especially because you’re an actor, you need to get a skill. You have to pretend you’re an astronaut or a fireman,” the Footloose star said at the time. “She was a little bit mad at me, but you know what? It was OK. I gave it the old college try.”</p><p>Sedgwick’s <a href=#>take on the incident</a> was a little more serious.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m not saying it was a disaster, but the fact that we did not have to go to the emergency room was just an absolute miracle,” she said during a separate conversation with <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> in January.</p><p>The movie stars have been married since 1988 and share two children: Travis, 31, and Sosie, 29.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksaKWerSxw6CuopubYsSpxYyiZLCZo6PBbrXNr6CtnZRir6KvymarqGWkpLpur9GuoKydo2K1sLnEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
