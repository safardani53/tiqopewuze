He was a defender for Deportivo Pereira and Atletico Nacional between 1980 and 1995 before deciding to pursue a coaching career. For many years, he worked as an assistant to Francisco Maturana, whom he saw as an inspiration and a father figure.&nbsp;In 1999, he took over as manager of his previous team Atletico Nacional, with whom he won the Colombian title 1999.&nbsp;He later coached Deportivo Cali, Deportes Tolima, and Aucas before taking over as manager of Ecuador in 2004 and bringing the team to its second World Cup victory in 2006.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Luis-Fernando-Suarez-2.jpg alt="Luis Fernando Suarez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After losing all three games against Venezuela, Brazil, and Paraguay on the third day of the qualifying, Saurez resigned.&nbsp;Before taking over Honduras in 2011, he was the manager of Aucas, Atletico Nacional, and Juan Aurich.&nbsp;He guided Honduras to the World Cup as the country finished third in the CONCACAF qualifying in Brazil.&nbsp;After the last game, he resigned and went on to manage Universitario, Dorados de Sinaloa, La Equidad, Junior, and Atlectico Bucaramanga.&nbsp;He left Atletico Bucaramanga in order to coach Costa Rica in 2021.</p><h2>He is obsessed with his third World Cup.</h2><p>Suarez has lately used the term obsession, and that obsession is his third World Cup, which he considers to be a positive fixation.&nbsp;He has a sign on his fridge door listing the nations Costa Rica would face if they qualified for the FIFA World Cup.&nbsp;Spain, Germany, Japan, and Costa Rica are the nations involved. He taped it on his refrigerator door since it’s never far from his thoughts.&nbsp;He is always going to the refrigerator because he drinks a lot of water. He describes the note as a means of seeing it.</p><p>According to him, he didn’t know what it was when he was in the first division, and after he found it out and performed well, the only thing he wanted to do was go back.&nbsp;When he obtained the Costa Rica job, he told himself that he had to go for it because he would die if he didn’t.&nbsp;And that is where he is now: midway between death and obsession, hoping that his fixation triumphs.&nbsp;This will be his third World Cup appearance, having previously represented Ecuador in 2006 in Germany and Honduras in 2014 in Brazil.&nbsp;His perseverance came off, and his dedication was rewarded when Costa Rica qualified for the World Cup.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Luis-Fernando-Suarez-3.jpg alt="Luis Fernando Suarez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Costa Rica completed the 32-nation FIFA World Cup field after defeating New Zealand 1-0 in an intercontinental playoff in Qatar. Suarez completed his World Cup hat trick. Saurez said after the win,</p><p>“This team exemplifies what it’s like to be a Costa Rican.” They never give up and always give their all.&nbsp;“It has always been a preoccupation of mine.” Being in this situation is lovely.”</p><h2>Marriage</h2><p>Suarez has kept his personal life under wraps. He is, however, married and has a family.&nbsp;The specifics of his nuptials are unknown. He is also a grandpa since his grandson was mentioned in one of the interviews.&nbsp;Aside from that, nothing is known about his family. Suarez’s personal life has remained private, therefore it is unclear how many children he has.&nbsp;There is also no information regarding his girlfriends or previous relationships.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijrqGjYrOmvs2apZ2nXajCor7Es2SsrJGpsqV506GYrWWYmnqqv4yomaydo6iypXnWoquhZZOkurGx06KloGWZo3qptdJmq6Ghopl6uLvRpZtmm6WlfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
