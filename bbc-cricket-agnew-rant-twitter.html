Morale and camaraderie is a big part in team performance."</p><p>And Liew wrote: "[This] feels instinctively unarguable - who doesn’t love morale and camaraderie, after all?</p><p>"Until you begin to ask why Archer is deemed such a grave threat to it."</p><p>The Independent's columnist later added: "There’s an incendiary word you could posit to describe all this, but I’m not going to use it."</p><p>Agnew, 59, then sent Liew a number of direct messages on Twitter, calling him a "c**t" on numerous occasions.</p><p>He wrote: "I'm going no further on the advice of people I have heard back from who know you and think you are a c***.
