Boyfriend And Relationship Timeline</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>It’s evident that if you’re in the spotlight, you’re on the radar of people who want to know everything about your life. <strong>Martina Sablikova</strong> is in a similar situation. Fans are interested in learning more about her companion. Sablikova is not presently in a relationship, according to reports. Furthermore, her instructor, Petr Novak, believes that to win gold, she must avoid falling in love. “You can have a boyfriend, but don’t fall in love,” Novak said. Everything changes when you fall in love; you may as well give up.” This might also explain why she has remained unmarried and focused on her professional career. Or she might be excellent at keeping her secrets hidden. However, over Martina’s 18-year career in skating and cycling, there have been a few reports regarding her relationship.</p><p>Martina Sablikova, a professional Czech speed skater, was born on May 27, 1987, in Nové Msto na Morav, Czechoslovakia, to Milan Sablik and Eva Sablikova. Sáblková won the Czech youth championship three times as a junior, in 1999, 2001, and 2004. She also achieved a junior world record in the 3000m, finishing in 4:00.69. At the European Speed Skating Competition in 2007, she won her first big competition. Successive important victories have continued Sablikova’s success. She has also participated in the Winter Olympics, winning gold, silver, and bronze medals.</p><h2>Martina Sablikova’s Relationship Status: Is She Dating?</h2><p>The great skater has been in the sport for about two decades, and there are some dating rumors about her today. Martina is now possibly single, with no evidence that she is dating anybody. No possible partners have been seen with her in recent years. Sablikova, on the other hand, was supposedly in a relationship and proclaimed her satisfaction. She also expressed her gratitude for having a boyfriend who understands her demanding schedule and manages it graciously. However, the love did not endure.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Martina-Sablikova-1.jpg alt="Martina Sablikova" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For a long time, many wondered whether Martina Sáblková’s boyfriend was her trainer, Petr Novák, who is about forty years her senior.&nbsp;With the growing conjecture, they addressed the issue publicly in an interview and refuted all of the charges.&nbsp;Rumors surfaced in 2011 that she was dating Czech ice hockey star Tomas Plekanec. However, none of them confirmed their connection.&nbsp;There were also speculations that she was dating Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer.</p><h2>Rio Controversy: Is She Going</h2><p>As a world-class cyclist, Sáblková has long hoped to compete in the Olympic time trial event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.&nbsp;Martina won a berth in Rio 2016 by finishing 12th in the women’s time trial at the UCI World Road Championships in Richmond, United States, in 2015.&nbsp;However, when the UCI announced the list of countries that qualified for this event at Rio 2016, the Czech Republic was not among them.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Martina-Sablikova-2.jpg alt="Martina Sablikova" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The UCI interpreted the qualifying criteria such that an athlete must also qualify for the road race.&nbsp;She flew to Rio hoping that the judgment would be reversed; unfortunately, the ruling stood, and she did not compete. Many people, including Martina, were disappointed and thought it was unjust.&nbsp;She then proceeded to compete in other games. She announced her retirement plans in October 2026.&nbsp;Her agent amended her comments, adding that the Czech speed skater will most likely retire after the Olympics in 2026.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWdlr%2B1tc2aZKyZkqG2rLvVmmSdmaSeu6h5wKewqKaVYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGKur7CMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZqyZorKttc2eZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
