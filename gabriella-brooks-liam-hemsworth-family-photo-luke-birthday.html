This appears to have been the case since the very beginning of the model’s relationship with Liam. After all, when the two were first spotted out together in Dec. 2019, they were joined by the actor’s mom and dad. Now, they’ve been together for about a year, and are definitely going strong.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Liam started <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating Gabriella</a>, who’s from his native, Australia, after his split from&nbsp;<strong>Miley Cyrus</strong> during summer 2019.
