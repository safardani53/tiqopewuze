He was running a nice race in the Grade 1 Neville Hotels Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas when we parted company quite early.</p><p>It was too early in the race to know how he would have done, but he was travelling well at the time. I was very happy with him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>He was beaten last time in a Grade 3 chase at Naas, but the ground was too tacky for him, and he wasn't beaten far in the end.</p><p>He isn't a horse who would want very soft ground, but he won his point-to-point on soft ground, so he can handle it.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON THE CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON THE CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL</a></strong></p><p>He feels like a horse who is well able for this standard of race. He's going to have to improve, but he should improve, and his jumping is one of his strong attributes.</p><p>I think that he could be a little bit under-estimated.</p><p><strong>2.50 - WATCH HOUSE CROSS</strong></p><p>Watch House Cross was beaten in his first three chases earlier this season, but he was much better back over hurdles in the Brown Lad Handicap Hurdle at Naas in November.</p><p>He was beaten last time in another competitive handicap at Leopardstown off a 6lb higher mark, but that was over two miles.</p><p>He should appreciate going back up in trip in the Coral Cup. He goes well on soft ground and he seems to be in great form at home.</p><p>He is still lightly raced, he still has the potential to improve more, and he goes into the race with a good each-way chance.</p><p><strong>3.30 - CAPTAIN GUINNESS</strong></p><p>Captain Guinness has been running solidly all year.</p><p>He was impressive in winning the Fortria Chase at Navan in November on his seasonal debut, and he finished second behind Blue Lord in the Grade 1 Paddy's Rewards Club Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas, when he had good horses behind him.</p><p>He is going to have to improve again on that if he is going to be involved in the Champion Chase, he has a little bit to find on ratings, but he's in great order at home, and I wouldn't be surprised if he ran above his rating and his odds.</p><p>He's a classy horse, and he deserves to take his chance in a race like this.</p><p><strong>4.10 - GIN ON LIME</strong></p><p>I'm looking forward to riding Gin On Lime in the Cross Country Chase.</p><p>This will be her first run in a race over the cross-country track, but she schooled over the course a couple of months ago, and she was good. I schooled her over the track again on Monday morning, and she went great.</p><p>Not many horses have won the Cross-Country Chase on their first run at the track in the past.</p><p>But the fact that she seems to really enjoy it is obviously a big positive.</p><p>She hasn't run since she finished fourth in the Kerry National at Listowel in September, but she seems to be in really good form, and I'd be hoping that she can run into a place at least.</p><p><strong>4.50 - EPSON DU HOUX</strong></p><p>I ride Epson Du Houx in the Grand Annual, and I hope that he can run well.</p><p>He ran well the last day in the Dan & Joan Moore Memorial Chase at Fairyhouse to finish third behind Rebel Gold, and Rebel Gold has since won the Grade 3 Newlands Chase.</p><p>Epson Du Houx used to be quite keen, but he is settling better now, he is much more straightforward than he used to be.</p><p>He goes well on soft ground, so soft ground would be a positive for him.</p><p><strong>5.30 - WESTERN DIEGO</strong></p><p>Western Diego is a lovely ride to pick up for Willie Mullins in the Champion Bumper. It's never easy for Paddy to choose which of Willie's to ride in the bumper.</p><p>Everything that Willie runs has to be respected obviously, they all have their chances, and Western Diego was impressive in winning his bumper at Naas on his only run to date on the racecourse.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>That was on soft ground, he made all the running and he won well. He won his only point-to-point too.</p><p>He is going to have to improve again obviously, but he should improve for that experience and he goes there with a chance.</p><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yg5BvbnFrX5i1prjTnqWhmZ1isaLFjK2uqGWilrCprcSlZJukkZi4rrvRnmSpqpWrtqbDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
