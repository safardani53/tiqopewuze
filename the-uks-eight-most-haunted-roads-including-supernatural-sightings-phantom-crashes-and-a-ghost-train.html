will always be a little bit more of a ghostly feel to those foggy mornings and dark, eerie nights onHalloween.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000332439333.jpg><p>For some motorists, driving at night can be scary enough as it is, without having to worry about ghoulish predators lurking in the shadows.</p><p>But according to a study by <a href=# rel=noopener>comparethemarket.com</a>, more than 1.5 million British drivers are on edge about the possibility of seeing a ghost on the road.</p><p>And if there is any night when you are most likely to get a glimpse of a ghoul, its October 31.</p><p>Brits have reported seeing spooky clowns, witch-shaped clouds and bizarre green flashes while driving on Halloween.</p><p>So if you are the superstitious type, these are the British roads you will want to avoid on the spooky night this year.</p><h3>Barford Bridge, Northamptonshire</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-173030906.jpg><p>Joining Kettering and Corby, the stretch of bridge along the A6003 is said to be haunted by a bearded monk, who appears in front of drivers at night.</p><p>One incident reported by a police officer in 2009 prompted the&nbsp;Northamptonshire Paranormal Investigation Team to set up a night watch in the area, and reported&nbsp;an unusual drop in temperature, as well as loud banging when they tried to make contact with the spirit world.<br></p><h3>The Devil’s Highway, near Bolton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_688636594.jpg><p>This stretch of the devilishly named A666 is allegedly home to a dark shadow that appears in front of motorist.</p><p>A number of accidents have been attributed to apparent sightings, and footage even emerged in 2015 claiming to show a shadowing figure crossing the road.<br></p><h3>Blue Bell Hill, Kent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/annie-spratt-195899.jpg><p>Locals to the area claim the victim of a fatal road accident in 1965 haunts the road.</p><p>Wearing a wedding dress, the image of a woman allegedly jumps in front of drivers who then think they have run her over, only for the vision to disappear when they get out of their car.<br></p><h3>Cock Lane, near the Old Bailey in London</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-496634510.jpg><p>One of the houses on this street is said to be haunted by the ghosts of two women who died in the residence back in the 1760s.</p><p>While drivers might not see anything on the road, many believe you can still hear strange noises and screams as you travel past.<br></p><h3>The Ghost Road, Dumfries and Galloway</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_380957782.jpg><p>The Kinmount Straight between Gretna and Dumfries has seen its fair share of allegedly phantom collisions with pedestrians.</p><p>Sightings of disappearing road casualties have been reported since the 1950s.</p><p>In 1997, Donna Maxwell even reported a collision with a pedestrian to police, but neither could find any trace of a victim.<br></p><h3>The Old Tay Bridge, Dundee</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_427565.jpg><p>On December 28, 1879, Britain's worst ever bridge disaster saw a six-carriage train plunge into the icy waters off the coast of Scotland as the Tay Bridge collapsed.</p><p>All 75 passengers on the train were killed.</p><p>According to a legend, on the anniversary of the tragedy each year, a ghost train can be seen crossing the old stretch of bridge.<br></p><h3>The B519 by The Spaniard’s Inn, Hampstead</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-490085040.jpg><p>A sharp turn in the B519 just before The Spaniard's Inn in Hampstead is said to be haunted by an eighteenth-century highway man.</p><p>The ghost's father allegedly owned the pub for a time, and his ghoulish son still walks the road looking to prey on motorists.<br></p><h3>Sally in the Woods, Wiltshire</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_343658807.jpg><p>This treacherous stretch of the A636 is supposed to be the site of the tragic death of a young girl who was struck when she ran into the road.</p><p>Motorists have reported numerous sightings, and as many as seven fatal accidents in the area have been left with no logical explanation for their cause - leading many to think they are the result of paranormal intervention.</p><p>Earlier this year we reported on the frightening ghost of "Kelly", who<a href=# rel=noopener> haunts the notorious Wakehurst Parkway in Sydney, Australia.&nbsp;</a></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">The motoring world's most bizarre and amazing</h2></p><p class=postsid
