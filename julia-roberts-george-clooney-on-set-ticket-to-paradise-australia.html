Clooney was discussing with newcomer Daniel Ranieri , 10, about their new movie The Tender Bar when Roberts popped in for a few moments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh my goodness, wow. Holy moly," Kimmel said when Roberts rolled in on a chair to Clooney's side, wearing sunglasses and staying silent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"George, I don't know if you're aware of this, but there's a woman sitting next to you," the comedian teased, as Clooney playfully pretended to be unaware. As Roberts rolled away, Kimmel joked, "Maybe I hallucinated that. It looked like Julia Roberts though."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Julia Roberts and George Clooney.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ticket to Paradise also stars Kaitlyn Dever and Billie Lourd, who recently opened up on Instagram about working in Australia while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mourning the five-year anniversary</a> of mom Carrie Fisher's death. She even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>performed a Fleetwood Mac song</a> on Instagram with help from Dever, 25, to pay tribute to Fisher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm working away from home right now and one night when I was having a particularly grief-y moment this song came on and the lyrics spoke (well actually sang) to me more than they ever had before," Lourd, 29, captioned the post. " 'Well I've been afraid of changing cause I built my life around you. But time makes you bolder.' I didn't know who to be or what to do after my mom died. I was afraid of changing because I had built my life around her. Then she was gone."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And I had to rebuild my life without her. And it wasn't (and still isn't) easy," she continued. "But time has made me bolder. I never stop missing her but I have gotten stronger with each passing year. And if you're going through something similar time will make you bolder too. Sorry for this cheesy lyric analysis. But it's true!!!

"My wife and I had this conversation when I turned 60 this summer. I said, 'I can still bounce around pretty good, and we both love what we do. But we gotta make sure we don't book ourselves silly.'
