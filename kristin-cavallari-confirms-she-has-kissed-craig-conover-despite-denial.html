So, we’re all friends.”</p><p class=p1>Cohen, 55, then asked if she and Conover <a href=#>ever “hooked up.”</a></p><p class=p1>“I may have been drunk one night and kissed Craig,” the <a href=#><i>Hills</i> </a>alum confessed, before denying that anything romantic has happened with Kroll, 36.</p><p class=p1>Reports swirled in July 2021 that Cavallari was <a href=#>involved in a love triangle</a> with Conover and Kroll.</p><p class=p1>“Lindsay [Hubbard], was like, on the, like, whole car ride with Austen, she was like, ‘Who was Kristin hooking up with? Craig or Austen?’” <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a>, Conover’s girlfriend, <a href=#>asked her partner during an episode</a> of <i><a href=#>Summer House</a> </i>that was taped later that month. (The footage aired in January 2022.)</p><p class=p1>The <a href=#>Sewing Down South</a> founder interrupted DeSorbo, claiming that Kroll “hates that I was making out [with Kristin].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kristin-Cavallari-Actually-Did-Kiss-Southern-Charms-Craig-Conover-Despite-Denying-Hookup-Claims2.jpg><p class=p1>Cavallari, for her part, <a href=#>shut down the claims</a>. “I haven’t dated anybody in a few months. These two guys who I have been linked to for the past year are my friends. That’s it,” she <a href=#>wrote via her Instagram Story</a> at the time. “I’ve never dated either one of them. I can guarantee that I’m not going to date either one of them. It’s possible for a grown woman to be friends with a grown man.”</p><p class=p1>Cavallari and the Bravo stars first became friends in 2020 <a href=#>following her divorce</a> from ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Jay Cutler</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“She came to town with her friend <a href=#><strong>Justin [Anderson]</strong> </a>and the four of us [with Craig] had dinner,” Kroll <a href=#>exclusively told<i> Us Weekly</i> that October</a>. “We’ve all been in contact ever since. We’re in this, like, big old group chat, and the group chat is active. We had a blast with them and I’m gonna take a trip to see them in Nashville sometime soon.”</p><p class=p1>While Cavallari <a href=#>did not end up in a relationship</a> with either Conover or Kroll, she exclusively told <i>Us</i> earlier this month that she is currently dating.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve gone through phases of going on a million first dates, and I’ve gone through phases where I’m not dating at all,” she said<a href=#> via her <i>Us</i> cover story</a>. “At the moment, it’s not my priority, but I’m open to it. …&nbsp; I want that passion and fire. I feel like if it’s meant to be, he’ll find me. I don’t know where, because I hardly ever leave my house! Hopefully, it will happen at the grocery store.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Cavallari further explained that she has “high standards” because of <a href=#>her and Cutler’s three kids</a>: sons Camden, 10, and Jaxon, 8, and daughter Saylor, 7.</p><p class=p1>“They met one person once because they were a fan of his. They <a href=#>asked me to go out with him</a> when they were with me so that they could meet him,” she recalled to <i>Us</i>. “I’m very open with them; they know what’s going on in my love life and who I’m talking to. And they have strong opinions! I haven’t found someone who’s special enough to be around them yet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYycpqeemae6tHnSoZxmoJGoeqy10qycnWWTp66qs4ycpqenppq%2FbrDErKeirJVisaa6yJqjaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
