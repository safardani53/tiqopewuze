Caroline is of German and Brazilian descent and can speak three languages; English, German and Portuguese.</p><p>The fuzzy-haired stunner also does modelling, particularly on Instagram where she has over 244,000 followers under <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@caroviee.</a></p><h3>Why is she so so so annoying?</h3><p>From day one, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Caro</span></a> has seemed a little on the crazy side. During the first coupling ceremony, she routinely stepped away from her man, Cashel Barnett, seemingly keen to couple up with just about anyone.</p><p>However, once she was left with Cash, she acted besotted by 27-year-old, telling him not to talk to any of the other girls in the Fiji&nbsp;villa and smothering him with affection.</p><p>The same now applies to Caro and Bombshell entry Cormac Murphy, who made the mistake of showing Caro the slightest nudge of attention.</p><p>https://twitter.com/hannahld23/status/1148763223782559744</p><h3>What have you been saying on Twitter?</h3><p>Those on Twitter have not taken kindly to Caro and her severe demand for attention. Viewers have voiced everything from concern over her actions to sheer dismay.</p><p>However, it‚Äôs also her squealing voice that has put off many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Love Island USA</span> </a>fans.</p><p>The CZA said: ‚ÄúIs Caro annoying on Love Island or is it just me? And I can never understand what she‚Äôs saying because of her ‚Äòflirty voice‚Äô that sounds like a toddler.‚Äù</p><p>Another said: ‚ÄúWatching Love Island and while Caro is a beautiful woman and does have a fun personality, her breaking into a baby voice is driving me insane. Total pet peeve. ‚Äù</p><p>And just to summarise how bizarre and annoying Caro‚Äôs alternating accent and squeaky high-pitch tones are, viewers realised that even her laugh is subtitled.</p><p>That‚Äôs how obscure her voice is!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They really put Caro‚Äôs weird laugh in the captions üòÇüòÇ <a href=#>#LoveIsland</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PjyWBmEO18</a></p><p>‚Äî nat (@imtryingdamn) <a href=#>July 15, 2019</a></p></figure>View Tweet<h3>How to watch Love Island USA ‚Äì final looming!</h3><p>Unlike Love Island UK, the American version only lasts four weeks.</p><p>The final will air on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>CBS</span></a> on Wednesday, August 7th.</p><p>The series airs every weeknight at 8 pm until this date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnnKTDpnnIrKOappRixKnFjK6qmmWkrLa1wMSrZJyZnql6uK3IrWStp12csrV50aKbZqeWYq6vus6yoKefXZius7uMr6CeoKeatA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
