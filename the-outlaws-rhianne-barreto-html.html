Yes, her family had no connections, but she had one thing that most kids like herself did not — supportive parents.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Rhianne Barreto's Parents Greenlit Her Acting</h2><p>"I know so many people that wanted to act but have parents that were like, ‘go to uni, study something normal first,'"&nbsp;she told the outlet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So it was of utmost importance to her that she be the trailblazer for so many more like herself.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"I’ve asked not to do best friend roles anymore," she professed.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to demean supportive roles, but to stand up for her people.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"I think it’s really important that unless it’s a [expletive] great role, brown or non-white people aren’t just playing the supporting lead so that big productions don’t get blasted for not being diverse," she argued.</p><p>That being said,&nbsp;Barreto was also considering dabbling into artforms other than acting, directing to be precise.
