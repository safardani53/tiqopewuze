The hit-maker appeared on Good Morning Britain on July 5, where hosts <strong>Kate Garraway</strong> and <strong>Adil Ray</strong> asked about his tumultuous romance with the famed reality star. “What was that like dating someone in the public eye?” Garraway asked Tyga who appeared to hesitate. “It’s just dating… you just date, you move on, you date again, you move on. It’s just a part of life, it’s part of evolving. It’s just learning,” he replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>When pressed further, the “Rack” City rapper remained tight-lipped. “There’s no preparation; you just have to learn from mistakes and grow better,” he said, leaving Kylie’s name out of the conversation. When then asked about his “regrets,” Tyga put a halt to the questioning.&nbsp; “Nah. I don’t want to talk too much about it. Do you know what I’m saying?” he firmly replied.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tyga and the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star shared a whirlwind romance beginning in 2014 when he was 25 and Kylie was just 17. They split three years later. As fans know, Kylie is now happily dating rapper <strong>Travis Scott</strong> with whom she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shares a daughter</a> with. Meanwhile, Tyga has been dating model <strong>Cindy Kimberly.</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why is Tyga on Good Morning Britain? 😂 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/Tb1ZOb6xmZ</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Urenna Okonkwo (@urennalexa) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 5, 2019</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Fans were even a little confused about Tyga’s placement on the morning talk show in the first place.
