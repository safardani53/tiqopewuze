For years, the Casa Hogar orphanage, which is based in Cabo San Lucas, was struggling financially. When Hurricane Odile devastated the area (and the structure of Casa Hogar) in 2014, the orphanage's guardian, Omar, decided to finally ask for help.</p><p>He partnered with an American fishing captain, Wade Malloy, so he could enter the Bisbee's Black & Blue Fishing Tournament, which had a prize of over $250,000.</p><p>Though Wade is motivated in the film to help Omar because he can avoid a four-figure entry fee by participating in the tournament with locals, in reality, a donor paid for Casa Hogar to compete.</p><p>Several of the boys at Casa Hogar joined Wade and Omar on the boat at the tournament.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Wade was initially the only one with any fishing experience, he was able to teach Omar and the boys the proper techniques. Just five weeks after the hurricane rocked the Cabo San Lucas area, the tournament took place.</p><p>During the competition, Team Casa Hogar managed to secure the victory after they caught a 382-pound blue marlin. They won the $258,325 prize money, which enabled Omar to save Casa Hogar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to saving the orphanage, the significant winnings also allowed Casa Hogar to expand with a program for girls.</p><p>They were the first team from Mexico to ever win the competition.</p><p>The key details of the true feel-good story have been reflected in Blue Miracle.
