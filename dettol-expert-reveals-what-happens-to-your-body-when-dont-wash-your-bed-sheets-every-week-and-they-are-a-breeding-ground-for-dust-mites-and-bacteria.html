Load two pillows at a time into the washing machine then stick them in the tumble dryer with a few tennis balls to stop the filling clumping"</p><p>According to Dr Ackerley our beds are a "great place" for various bacteria and fungi to breed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nintchdbpict000288561304.jpg><p>This bacteria can build up if bed sheets aren't changed regularly and can cause infections.</p><p>Athlete's foot, yeast infections, viruses and dust mites can all build up in unclean beds and cause health problems if left unchecked.</p><p>So what can be done for a healthy bed? Dr Ackerley recommends:</p><ul><li>First, get rid of the dust! Vacuum the room and around and under the bed, and the mattress. Send your duvet off to be cleaned – I have a winter and summer one, and have them cleaned when swapped over (by the way if space is tight, invest in a vacuum bag to store your spare clean bedding). Wash pillows if they can be washed and tumble dry to stop clumping, - or send them off to the laundry as well. Use pillow protectors on your nice clean (or new) pillows and a mattress protector – you can wash theses easily. Spray the mattress with Dettol all in one Disinfectant Spray when having a spring or autumn clean, and destroy any nasty germs and bugs that may be lurking there</li><li>Wash bedding at above 60<strong>°</strong>C<strong>&nbsp;</strong>if you can, or even higher – I have white cotton and go to 90<strong>°</strong>C. This blitzes everything – but if you have more delicate fabrics, then wash at a lower temperature but always use a laundry cleanser such as Dettol which will zap the germs without ruining your sheets. Remember bacteria grow best at body temperature, so a 30-40 degree wash isn’t going to do the job without a laundry cleanser</li><li>Wash bedding once a week if you can, or at least every two weeks</li><li>Have a shower before bed – then you keep the dirt down! At the very least, wash your hands before bed-time</li><li>Wash nightwear every three days</li><li>Have some anti-bacterial wipes handy in case you have any spills</li><li>If you have a cat or dog and allow it on the bed get a blanket for them to lie on and wash that every week at least</li><li>If someone is ill, step up the cleaning and launder the linen more frequently.</li></ul><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
