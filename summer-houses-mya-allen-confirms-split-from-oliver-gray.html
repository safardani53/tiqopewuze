I lived six years of life in the shadow of my ex,” she explained of the Top Chef alum during a January 2022 episode of Summer House. “He was very popular, very successful, and I would find myself being identified on his behalf. I was his fiancée, or I worked with him. And for my ego, that f–king sucked.”</p><p>She added: “I moved to New York about two years ago with my ex. That relationship didn’t work out, but my relationship with New York is still very strong.”</p><p>Allen made it clear she wanted to take things slow with Gray, but confirmed in the season 7 premiere of Summer House, which filmed in July 2022 and aired earlier this month, that the twosome were going strong. During the same episode, Allen claimed<a href=#> <strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong> accused her of being romantically interested in <strong>Carl Radke</strong>.</a> Allen denied having feelings for Radke (who is engaged to Hubbard), arguing with the publicist over texting the Pittsburgh native to smoke weed following a cast appearance on Celebrity Family Feud in February 2022.</p><p>“I thought it was weird, for sure. I mean, I didn’t actually respond,” Radke told Us earlier this month. “I was in a separate car leaving Family Feud with <strong>Andrea [Denver]</strong> and <strong>Alex [Wach]</strong> and I was driving back, and I got the text and I was like, ‘This is a little weird.’ Like, she’s in the car with Lindsay right now. … We would text here and there, but we didn’t, like, hang out outside of the house unless it was with other people.”</p><p>Radke has been candid about his sobriety journey, marking two years without alcohol in January.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Lindsay obviously has my best interest in trying to communicate and I appreciate that. Mya was very supportive of us toward the end of the summer … which really meant a lot,” he added. “And I think that brought us, you know, closer and we love Mya. I think it was just kind of an awkward moment.”</p><p>Summer House airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrZ2isrN5x6isrJ2jYrq6rYyao6WdnmKwsLrFoqmmq12ova2102adq6edYryttdWeqWafopbGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
