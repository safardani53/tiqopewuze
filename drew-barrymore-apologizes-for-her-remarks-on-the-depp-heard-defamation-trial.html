On Friday’s broadcast of The Drew Barrymore Show, she and guest Anthony Anderson addressed the slander suit. Her views on the current court case, on the other hand, were not warmly received by netizens.&nbsp;During a segment on her program on the trial, Barrymore said that she “can’t stand” it. She also said that it was “a seven-layer dip of craziness, like one layer of insane.”</p><p>The actress, 47, said that it was “very intriguing” before revealing:</p><p>“I understand that these are two people’s genuine lives, and I understand what it’s like to have your life made public.” I understand all of your emotions, but they’re really revealing things that no one needed to know. This is insane!”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Drew Barrymore hasn’t been relevant since Scream & from then on her life has been a tragic theater of failed relationships & drug problems so for her to sit on her clown show & laugh at Johnny Depp’s pain & invalidate male abuse victims is a truly grotesque sociopathic display</p><p>— shelby ☽❂♃♄♇ (@oceannebulaopal) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 1, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Hi <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@DrewBarrymore</a>, how about telling the world what exactly it is you’re apologizing for?

According to the Blended actress:</p><p>“Hello, it has come to my notice that I have upset people by making fun of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, and for that, I really regret and thank everyone who came out since this may be an educational opportunity for me.” And how I go and behave myself.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drew-Barrymore-2.jpg alt="Drew Barrymore" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actress-turned-TV presenter went on to say that she is learning how to be a “more thoughtful and better person” in the future since all she wants to be is a “nice person.” She went on to say:</p><p>“I appreciate the profundity of this, and I will develop and change as a result of it.”</p><p>Drew Barrymore concluded her Instagram message with:</p><p>“I want to thank everyone who has helped me develop and taught me along the road.” Thank you very much.”</p><h2>What has recently come to light in the court battle?</h2><p>The American Civil Liberties Union said that they had not received $3.5 million from Amber Heard after she agreed to contribute half of her divorce settlement to the organization and the other half to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.&nbsp;Executives at the ACLU said that they had only received $1.3 million, including $500 000 from an Elon Musk-linked fund. Heard was supposedly in a relationship with the new Twitter owner for a short time.</p><p></p><p>It was also stated that the Aquaman actress was unable to meet the balance of the promise due to financial difficulties.&nbsp;Dr. Shannon Curry, a forensic psychologist hired by Johnny Depp’s legal team, also alleged that Heard suffers from borderline and histrionic personality disorders.&nbsp;According to reports, the two are characterized by “much rage, brutality against others who are less powerful, and attention-seeking.”&nbsp;Curry went on to say that the conduct is motivated by “an underlying dread of desertion.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibq52nYq%2BivtGypKiqlWKusbvLqJ6ispWoeqe70Wafnqpdp7KurdGkqmannmLBqbGMnZypqF2dsqK%2Bw2abnp6Roq61tc6nZK2qmZa5cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
