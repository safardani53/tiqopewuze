The reality TV teen just turned 16, and mom <strong>Teresa Giudice</strong> threw her oldest daughter a lavish purple-themed party on Jan. 8, to mark the special occasion.

Just as sweet as the 16-year-old herself, were the loving messages her proud mama posted on Instagram, along with photos of the event. “Happy Sweet 16th Birthday Gia. Your [sic] my pride and joy. Hope you had a great time at your party with your friends,” reads one message. “Happy Sweet 16 my beautiful @_giagiudice Love you so much Mommy,” reads another.</p><h3><strong>Check Out Other Celebrity Kid Birthday Parties</strong></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>The mommy/daughter duo were decked out in their finest designer duds (natch!), with Teresa sporting a black lace-up jumpsuit, and&nbsp;Gia rocking a super cute mini-dress by Castle Couture. Gia’s three little sisters, <strong>Gabriella</strong>, <strong>Milania</strong> and <strong>Audriana</strong> were also on hand to help her celebrate turning the big 1-6….but sadly, dad <strong>Joe Giudice</strong> was otherwise engaged.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Joe’s currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institute in Fort Dix, New Jersey, serving out a 41-month prison sentence for fraud. Teresa also did a stint behind bars, for the same offense — she served 11 months at the Federal Correctional Institute in Danbury, Conn, before her release in December 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The 43-year-old, who was known as Inmate No. 65703-050 to guards, and “Hollywood” to her fellow inmates, credited her four beautiful daughters for helping her get through her prison ordeal. “My kids, they do a lot,” the 44-year-old reality star said. “They have a lot of activities and they keep me busy, so the days fly by. Thank God for them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about Gia’s lavish sweet sixteen party?
