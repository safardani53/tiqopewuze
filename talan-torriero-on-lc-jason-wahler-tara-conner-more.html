People magazine caught up with the young hottie to talk about his <a href=#>famous flings</a>, as well as rumors about The Hills being a tad staged.</p><p>“They kind of found out who did what, who liked this person and who liked that person, and almost created characters on [The Hills],” <a href=#>Talan Torriero</a> said.</p><p>“When you watch it, it has the dynamics of a real show. Laguna Beach was as real as reality shows get. And it was shot in a way that people thought, is this real or fake?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The Laguna Beach grad and aspiring actor also dished a bit about a certain pair of high school friends and co-stars, <strong>Lauren Conrad</strong> and <strong>Jason Wahler</strong>.</p><p align=center>Lauren Conrad, Talan Torriero says, is still a very good friend of his, and her enormous success with The Hills and her other endeavors is very much deserved.</p><p>“I talk to Lauren all the time. She’s one of my best friends,” Torriero said. “We had a time where we didn’t really talk, because we just fell out of touch. Recently, I ran into to her and we started hanging out again. She’s a great girl. The Hills is huge. It’s definitely not a bad thing to be in your early 20s and have your own show on MTV and your own clothing line. She has a great future.”</p><p>As for <a href=#>Jason Wahler</a>, Torriero’s pal and Conrad’s ex, Torriero says he doesn’t “really talk to Jason … At the end of the day, I know he’s a great guy just from knowing him when I was a kid. We all have different ways of dealing with hard times.”</p><p>Talan Torriero also talked about his girlfriends, such as a rumored fling with Tara Conner, who he says “inspired me a lot, because she’s a girl who was put under a microscope by the entire nation, and she was able to overcome adversity.”</p><p>As for being <a href=#>Tara Conner</a>‘s current boyfriend, Talan Torriero denies it, saying the rebellious Miss USA stunner is “just a good friend.”</p><p>Torriero also explains his appeal to “older women,” including Pussycat Doll <strong>Nicole Scherzinger</strong>, 29, and former fiancée <strong>Kimberly Stewart</strong>, 28.</p><p>“You know what it is? I matured a lot faster than other people. A lot of the girls my age, not all of them, like to play games and I don’t like to do that,” Torriero says.</p><p>“I think older women go on a date with me, and then they say, ‘Wait, how old are you again?’ And then they’re like, ‘Well I’m already dating you, I might as well keep dating you.’ I’m not necessarily going after cougars or anything. At the end of the day, it’s just about being happy.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2lvX2Z9cMDApZinZaSkv7O1xKumZqeeYrmkecmaqqimXayuqbjEq2StmaKWeqS7zaecq2WdpL%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
