And unlike its show pony rivals — such as the Mitsubishi L200 and Nissan Navara — it’s all business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158541.jpg><p>It won’t find sales among wallies who think driving a pick-up makes them look cool — you know the type, Brylcreem-smeared personal trainers who chat up wobbly divorcees during Legs, Bums and Tums.</p><p>Ask those guys what three-and-a-half tonnes of towing capacity looks like and they’d probably point at the heaviest dumbbell they can lift.</p><p>But that’s what the D-Max can tug.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158322.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in motors</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158597.jpg><p>On top of that, it can carry around 500-1,000kg in the load bay, depending on the weight of the model you buy.</p><p>The pick-up market in the UK is booming, with a record 48,000 shifted in the last year.</p><p>And the D-Max is at the head of the pack. So what’s new compared to the 2015 model?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158610.jpg><p>The 2.5-litre diesel lump has been abandoned in favour of a greener 1.9-litre diesel turbo, resulting in a quieter and more refined drive.</p><p>More importantly, it brings the engine in line with Euro 6 emissions standards without having to use that horrible cleaning agent AdBlue in the tank — unlike most of its bigger-engined rivals.</p><p>This is a huge win for Isuzu. Take it from me, AdBlue is gruesome gunk (basically, it’s wee) and for a vehicle expected to cover huge mileage, not having to use it will save you money and time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158662.jpg><p>But a smaller engine means smaller torque outputs, yes? It does, but to compensate Isuzu has shortened the gearing ratios in first and second, and has added hill start assist, which works like a dream, even with maximum payload.</p><p>Hill descent and a shift-on-the-fly 4x4 system make it as capable off-road as anything made by Isuzu’s sister brand Subaru.</p><p>Playing with the spec levels will determine which exciting-but-pointless name your D-Max is awarded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158365.jpg><p>Top spec Blade has all the bells and whistles of a good-quality car, including sat nav, a 9in screen and so on.</p><p>It will set you back £27,000, but can box off a school run in Essex as easily as it can a deep-water crossing in the Hebrides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158361.jpg><p>But entry level Utility spec costs less than 16 grand, and while it loses the luxury touches, it possesses every ounce of durability the others have.</p><p>Look, I know manufacturers need to give pick-ups rugged names, that’s just the way of the world.</p><p>But the D-Max, whichever spec you plump for, is much more than an image — it’s the hardest-working employee you’ll ever hire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158375.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key facts</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158348.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>ISUZU D-MAX BLADE</p><p>Price: £26,999<br>Engine: 1.9-litre turbo diesel<br>Economy: 40.4mpg<br>Top speed: 112mph<br>Length: 5.3metres<br>CO2: 183g/km</p><h2>More attention than famous supercars</h2><p>READER Lee Robinson, from Lightwater, Surrey, says this beauty gets more attention than Lambos and Ferraris – and I can see why.</p><p>Lee says: “This is my 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314158348.jpg><p>“This is from the movie Smokey And The Bandit – ‘Breaker!

With the option of four setups, you’ll be pleased to hear all the pieces come as standard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314819135.jpg><p>The fit is superb and, thanks to a rubber seal, even with the goggles on it is surprisingly quiet. Premium Carl Zeiss lenses meant we never had to worry about fogging or scratches.</p><p>Like so many Bike World launches, we saw our fair share of rain, and that’s when the Explore-R’s extra features came in. With an effortless click, the half-strap goggles pop off and the visor slides and locks into place. It transforms the helmet into a solid street-fighter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314819160.jpg><p>The most impressive features, though, are the most subtle. In a pouch beneath where the shell ends is a rain hood. It pulls down and clips to the back to give a perfect seal between jacket and helmet.</p><p>There’s also the visor crack system, which opens the visor just enough to let some air in and prevent any fogging.</p><p>Our criticisms are minor. When you have the visor and the peak together, you can only open it three-quarters of the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nintchdbpict000314819116.jpg><p>And for an otherwise easy shield change system, the screw release bolt for the peak could have done with the same design attention as the rest, since we almost lost the fiddly bolt.</p><p>But it’s a premium helmet, at a much less premium price point of £389.99.</p><p>For more kit reviews head to <a href=#>bikeworld.co.uk</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHx0fphpa29tX57AtsbUZptmpZGteqO4wJ2cZqGjYsGpsYypnKuelZjBbrzInKJmpZViwrF7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
