The actress took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Feb. 14 to share a photo of a cake with the words “One Year” written across the center. However, the milestone had nothing to do with a relationship that reached an important anniversary. Rather, Lucy explained that she was celebrating one year of sobriety, which was something that the public did not know up until this point.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Bear with me, this is an alternative Valentine’s Day post,” Lucy wrote. “This is a post about self-love and about the greatest thing I’ve ever done. On January 2, 2023, I celebrated one year of sobriety. While this journey has mostly been private, I felt compelled tonight to let anyone who is struggling know that you are not alone and you are loved.”&nbsp; Lucy did not specify what led her to decide to go sober.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The comments section of the star’s Instagram post has been flooded with supportive comments from famous friends.&nbsp;<strong>Demi Lovato</strong>, who has been open about her own sobriety journey, wrote, “I’m so proud of you sis. I love you so much. Thank you for being a part of my journey and allowing me to be a part of yours.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lucy-hale-sober-1-year-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lucy’s&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars co-stars also weighed in, with&nbsp;<strong>Sasha Pieterse</strong> writing, “love you,” with a serious of happy emojis, and&nbsp;<strong>Shay Mitchell</strong> commenting with a red heart emoji.&nbsp;<strong>Troian Bellisario</strong> added, “Congratulations to you Lucy.
