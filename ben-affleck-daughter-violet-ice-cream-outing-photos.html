The teenager was out with dad&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Affleck</strong></a>, 48, for an ice cream date in Brentwood, California on Saturday, May 22. Violet — who is a clone of her mom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>, 49 — rocked a denim short-all ensemble with a long sleeve white shirt and&nbsp; blue lace sneakers. She kept her brown heir center parted and down, accessorizing with sunglasses and a nude face mask. The father-daughter duo were spotted enjoying treats from Sweet Rose Creamery inside the Brentwood Country Mart, which the Oscar winner is known to frequent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ben-Affleck-daughter-Violet-Reunion-jennifer-lopez-mega-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>As usual, the&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;actor stayed casual with a gray colored pair of jeans and a black t-shirt. He added a bomber style leather jacket on top, finishing his ensemble with a green pair of New Balance runners and a black face mask. At one point, Ben sweetly put his arm around Violet as they made their way down a Brentwood side walk, which is near where her mom Jennifer lives. Later, they could each be seen holding chocolate dipped cones to beat the balmy 75 degree weather.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ben has been out with his kids nearly every weekend since his getaway to Montana with ex-fiancée <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, 51. He took younger <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter <strong>Seraphina</strong>, 12</a>, shopping at a bookstore inside the same country mart on Saturday, May 16. The pair stayed low key in face masks as they carried brown-and-orange paper bags through the shopping facility, likely filled with their new reads.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ben-Affleck-daughter-Violet-Reunion-jennifer-lopez-mega-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The Boston native has also been out-and-about with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>youngest child,&nbsp;<strong>Samuel</strong>, 9</a>, in recent weeks.

Samuel was spotted in a blue wet suit and matching Adidas slides as he walked next to his dad after his lesson, seemingly headed back to a vehicle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s been two weeks Ben and J.Lo were spotted in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Big Sky, Montana</a> on a seemingly romantic getaway, marking the first time they were photographed together since their 2004 split. The two have reportedly rekindled their romance, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spending time together in Los Angeles</a> following the trip, despite her living primarily in Miami.&nbsp; “Jennifer was just in Los Angeles for a couple of days,”&nbsp;People magazine reported on Thursday, May 20.
