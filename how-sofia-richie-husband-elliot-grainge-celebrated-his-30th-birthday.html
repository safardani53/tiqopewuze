I am beyond obsessed with you,” she captioned an Instagram carousel earlier this month. “Happy birthday to the man of my dreams! I can’t wait for a lifetime more.”</p><p class=p1>The model married Elliot — whose parents are <strong>Lucian</strong> and <strong>Caroline Grainge</strong> — in April. Richie and her spouse<a href=#> tied the knot in a luxurious ceremony in Antibes, France</a>, after two years together. The nuptials were <a href=#>a star-studded affair</a>, with <a href=#><strong>Joel Madden</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Benji Madden</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a> and Sofia’s older sister, <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a>, all in attendance.</p><p class=p1>For the ceremony, Sofia stunned in <a href=#>three custom Chanel wedding gowns</a> as dad <a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a> walked her down the aisle.</p><p class=p1>“I always had this vision of the big princess dress, and going big, but as I got older, I realized that I wanted something a bit more simple,” Sofia, who is <a href=#>the daughter</a> of Lionel, 74, and ex-wife <strong>Diane Alexander</strong>, <a href=#>gushed to <i>Vogue </i></a>ahead of the big day. “Maybe ‘simple’ isn’t the right word, because my dress definitely is not simple. It is such magic. I honestly think Elliot is going to love it. He is my biggest cheerleader when it comes to anything I wear. If he doesn’t cry, I’ll be very sad.”</p><p class=p1>Since returning home from their French wedding and <a href=#>tropical honeymoon</a>, Sofia and Elliot have settled into married life — and their friends think they make the “perfect” match.</p><p class=p1>“[Elliot] has such a calm and loving nature about him and she never stops smiling when they’re together,” the insider adds. “Sofia loves that Elliot is so down-to-earth and appreciates a more low-key lifestyle.”</p><p class=p1>The source notes that <a href=#>the “easygoing” couple</a> are even happy just “ordering takeout and hanging at home on the couch.”</p><p class=p1>As Sofia and Elliot — a music industry executive — are still basking in newlywed bliss, <a href=#>they are not in a rush</a> to expand their family.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Sofia and Elliot only got married a few months ago,” the source tells <i>Us.</i> “So, they want to take some time to enjoy married life with just the two of them for now before they decide to bring a baby into this world.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Sarah Jones</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6diwLCyyJpkq6GTnbameceuqpuZnpl6prjLoqatZZenrqq6xp5knJ2cmq%2BzrdOem2agmah6dHzToWSboaKptaWt2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
