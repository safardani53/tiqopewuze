He’s also won over television audiences with his daily video horoscopes. Mercado’s enigmatic and larger-than-life personality — accented with colorful capes and exotic rings — and positive spiritual messages made him loved by the masses. Here are five reasons to fall under his spell.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>(Photo by Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images)</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">1. He found his psychic calling as a child. He had psychic abilities from an early age, when he predicted that the big bell at his elementary school would fall and says he healed a small bird by simply blowing air on him. He soon earned the name “Walter Miracles” in his neighborhood of Ponce. “I would get home from school, sit in a small chair and people would come to meet me. They touched me and kissed my hand. Like I was a pope, and I was a little boy!” he told People en Español. He admits sometimes having psychic abilities brings the wrong kind of attention: “People make you feel bad. They treat you like a little wizard.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">2. He started in the arts. Before he became a famous astrologer, he was an actor and dancer, appearing in various films, plays and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>telenovelas</a> in his native Puerto Rico. His dramatic flair and deep spiritual knowledge helped him become a TV star. He earned his own television show Walter and the Stars on the island, and later had a daily horoscope segment that aired for years in the United States on Univision’s news show Primer Impacto.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">3. He officiates weddings. Mercado has been a matchmaker to many couples and has even overseen the most significant part of their ceremonial union. “I have the title of Minister of the Church of Light and I have married a few couples. The interesting thing is those whom I join in matrimony, remain together.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">4. He appreciates the little things. The astrologer enjoys having aromatherapy baths in his jacuzzi, adding new fragrances to his vast perfume collection, reading a book on the hammock in his terrace or playing with his dog, Runo. “I discover happiness in the small details,” he told People en Español about living in the moment. “When I see a lotus flower blossom in my garden. When my puppy comes looking for me to play with him. Each day to me is a divine gift.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">5. He’s an expert on spirituality. In search of enlightenment, Mercado journeyed to exotic destinations such as Tibet, where he met the Dalai Lama; Morocco, where he studied with Sufi Muslims; and Mumbai, India, where he met Hindu mystic Osho. “I knocked on many doors. I am an eternal seeker,” he told People en Español. “When I looked within me, that’s when I found the truth in me. Light was inside of me.” The world traveler preaches about the importance of tolerance and compassion and reminds people of love’s power. Mercado closes every video cast with his famous phrase “mucho, mucho amor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5OdtqStjm5kraCZo7S0edOoZKSmn6x6uK3LrZyrZZ2av6Stw6hm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
