Cross country trip. Ever. Thanks in no part to Happy’s farts ❤️ p.s. Those stains are on my @doshombres shirt, @aaronpaul! I figured because we were mostly in the car all day, very few people would see said stained shirt! At least… fewer than a million 🙄.”</p><p>Some of the <a href=#>couple’s favorite meals</a> included sandwiches at Indiana’s Shapiro’s Delicatessen before stopping for a sweet treat at Long’s Bakery. Bosworth and Long also showed off the Asian cuisine at Yokozuna Yale in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Their stop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, featured dessert from The Paleta Project and a meal at Sawmill Market, which is part of the historic Sawmill District.</p><p>Bosworth and Long’s friends were quick to comment on their recent adventures.<strong> Brittany Snow</strong> noted that the pair <a href=#>define couple goals</a>, writing, “If love ain’t like this I don’t want it 🍔.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Justin-Long-and-Kate-Bosworth-Show-Us-Their-Favorite-Food-Spots-From-Cross-Country-Road-Trip-2.jpg><p>Long’s former costar<strong> Zooey Deschanel</strong> was thrilled by the food photos, adding, “I’m impressed at the double sandwich.”</p><p>Since going public with their romance, Long and Bosworth have often used social media to highlight adorable moments from their relationship. Long and Bosworth <a href=#>met while filming a movie</a> in 2021 and started dating after the model confirmed her split from then-husband <strong>Michael Polish</strong>.</p><p>Us Weekly exclusively confirmed in March that Bosworth and Polish <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a>. According to legal documents obtained by Us, the former spouses waived spousal support and agreed to divide all assets.</p><p>One month later, Bosworth announced that Long popped the question, writing via Instagram, “These things are funny to announce. How to do this right? He’s going the distance? I’ve got a Blue Crush? He’s just THAT into me? I’ve won a date with…??? Ok you get it! If life is short, find the one who brings you endless peace and radical wonder. ✨ @justinlong I am so grateful it’s you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Justin-Long-and-Kate-Bosworth-Show-Us-Their-Favorite-Food-Spots-From-Cross-Country-Road-Trip-3.jpg><p>The duo subsequently opened up on Long’s podcast, “Life Is Short,” about how he proposed “<a href=#>in a very organic way</a>” following a couples therapy session.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We had just gone through this really hard thing and we had spoken to a therapist and we were trying to move through things at the time and she gave us a really great piece of advice which was: ‘Make sure that you’re pretty consistently asking the other what you need, or asking the other what they need,’” Bosworth explained during the April episode. “I remember waking up not so many mornings after that therapy session and I looked at Justin and I said … I smiled at you, and I said, ‘What do you need?’ And he, like, really looked at me and he said, ‘To spend my life with you.’ And I smiled and I said, ‘Well, yeah, you have that. Oh my gosh, you have that,’ and he said, ‘No, I mean I really want to spend my life with you.’”</p><p>The duo have since confirmed that they <a href=#>secretly tied the knot</a> by referring to each other as husband and wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOto6m2r3nLqKWgZZGjsW63wK2cZpqfqMSwvtOhZJ2nk6q6prrTZquhnZmneqS%2BzqyqZpufqru1vthmqaiZlGLBs7XPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
