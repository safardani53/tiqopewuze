The selection of Spanish shows on the streaming platform is just the type of quality content that inspires weekends dedicated to binge-watching — and possibly have you learning a second language along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>And we're not just talking about Narcos. Sure, Pablo Escobar is good, but have you heard of Fariña: Cocaine Coast? The book the show was based on — which tells a similar story of drug smuggling operations abroad — was temporarily banned in Spain before the series' release. Love Mad Men? Might we recommend <a href=#>Velvet</a>, which stars Miguel Angel Silvestre as Alberto, who is basically the Don Draper of 1950's Madrid.&nbsp;</p><p>From <a href=#>Cable Girls </a>to <a href=#>House of Flowers</a>, there is something for anyone who needs a good laugh or wants all the drama and romance of a really good telenovela.
