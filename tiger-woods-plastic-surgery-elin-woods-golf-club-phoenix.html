But this scenario would be hard to conceal.</p><p>No police reports suggested Tiger’s injuries were severe. Had they been, his wife likely wouldn’t have been let off the hook after their investigation.</p><p>Moreover, for Tiger freaking Woods to undergo surgery without anyone knowing, during a global media firestorm no less, seems dubious at best.</p><p><strong>But who knows</strong>. Bisher is considered one of the top golf writers, and goes into great detail about the attack and “cover up” that followed Tiger’s crash.</p><p>His account states that Elin Woods drilled her husband in the face with a 9-iron after confronting him over text messages from <a href=#>Rachel Uchitel</a>.”</p><p>“At one point Tiger turned away to look at the TV, and as he turned back, Elin hit him on the right side of the face with the head of a 9-iron,” he writes.</p><p>“When she struck Tiger, she made a huge gash in the right side of his face next to his nose (causing his nose to bruise some), and virtually knocking two of his upper teeth out, and breaking the bone on the upper right side.”</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>MISTRESS #1</strong>: Rachel Uchitel’s affair with Tiger Woods may or may not have led to a face-breaking, but it definitely shattered the golfer’s formerly pristine reputation.</p><p>“Tiger ran scared as hell out of the house (which is why he had on no shoes) with Elin swinging the golf club wildly throughout the hallway to the garage.”</p><p><strong>Wow</strong>.</p><p>The source claims the first doctor Woods saw knows a cosmetic dentist and plastic surgeon in Phoenix who could make Tiger look as if nothing happened.</p><p>The Friday after Tiger was released from the hospital, he didn’t return home; he boarded a private plane for Phoenix, where he stayed until last Wednesday.</p><p>Lastly, the insider says reports of Tiger and Rachel <a href=#>still hitting it</a> are bogus, and while Elin has retained a divorce attorney, she has not filed any papers.</p><p>Whether this is true remains to be seen, but it would help explain why:</p><li>Tiger successfully vanished, doing so before the scandal broke.</li><li>The police were unable to interview Tiger following the crash.</li><li>Why he fled his own house in such a daze that he hit a tree.</li><li>Why he announced he is taking an indefinite break from golf.</li><p><strong>What do you think of this story? True or tabloid trash?</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2lxX2Z%2FcMDIoJyrZaekvKW%2FjKmjmquknrBuv9Srnp6qqWKyrbXNZq6op5Soeqi7y59knKSll3qxtM6epaKwXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
