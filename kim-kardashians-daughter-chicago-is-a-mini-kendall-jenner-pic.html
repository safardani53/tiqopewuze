The picture — which was originally posted by <a href=#>the KimKardashSassy fan page</a> — revealed just how similar the niece and aunt are these days.</p><p>Chicago, who is the third child of Kardashian and ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, starred into the camera in the snap. (The exes also share <a href=#>daughter North, 9, and sons Saint, 6, and Psalm, 3</a>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kim-Kardashian-Reveals-Daughter-Chicago-Is-Becoming-a-Mini-Version-of-Aunt-Kendall-Jenner2.jpg><p>The little one’s pouted lips, full eyebrows and pointed chin are all <a href=#>signature features that Jenner possesses</a>. Chicago even nailed <a href=#>the model’s intense eye contact</a> in the photo.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Chicago has been compared to her famous aunt. In December 2021, fans pointed out that Kardashian’s third child was the <a href=#>spitting image of Jenner as she struck multiple model poses</a> in their annual Christmas card outtakes.</p><p>“Chicago is coming for auntie Kendall’s job,” one fan wrote at the time on the Selfish author’s post. A second Instagram user added, “Chicago is a natural! Watch out Kendall!”</p><p>The 818 Tequila founder, who is the only one of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings without kids, has been vocal over the years about being <a href=#>happy as just an aunt for now</a>.</p><p>“I have moments when I’m like, ‘Do I have baby fever? Do I want a baby right now?’ But I don’t, I don’t,” Jenner told <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in March 2018. “<a href=#>I can wait for a little while longer,</a> but it’s awesome because I have all these little babies to play with. So I can play with them and then just give them back. They’re all really cute.”</p><p>Jenner became an aunt in 2009 at the age of 14 when eldest sister, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, welcomed son Mason. (The Poosh founder, 43, and then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a> later added to their brood with Penelope and Reign in 2012 and 2014, respectively.)</p><p>The Rebels: City of Indra coauthor’s other sisters, Kim, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, have also become mothers in recent years. Khloé, 38, welcomed daughter True in April 2018 with then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson</strong></a>. Although the duo parted ways in 2021, Us Weekly confirmed in July that they are <a href=#>expecting their second child via surrogate</a>.</p><p>Kylie, for her part, gave birth to daughter Stormi in February 2018. The 24-year-old makeup mogul and <a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a> went on to welcome their second baby, a son, in February of this year.</p><p>Despite pressure from her mom, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, to have children sooner rather than later, Kendall has <a href=#>remained vocal about wanting to wait</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You keep telling me, ‘You’re not getting any younger.’ But guess what? It’s my life,” the Kendall + Kylie designer, who dated <a href=#><strong>Devin Booker</strong></a> for two years before splitting in June, <a href=#>told the 66-year-old momager</a> on a May episode of The Kardashians. “I don’t know if I’m ready yet.”</p><p>She added: “I still have a lot to figure out before I can, like, welcome a child into my life. I’m still, like, enjoying life on my own. And I’m OK with that right now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo8BusMCunqGslad6pLTInJigp12ewG6tjKagp6FdoLKvsMClo2ailaO7pr6MqaCcZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
