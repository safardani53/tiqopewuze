J.Lo, 53, sported a few different workout outfits for the brief ad, including a tight pink sports bra and matching biker shorts, as she sipped the sports beverage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Some of the “I’m Real” popstar’s other looks included a white tanktop and baggy black sweats, as she rehearsed with a microphone and a blue sweatsuit as she walked through her kitchen. Besides practicing her stage moves, J.Lo got some stretches in, as well as free-weight exercises, and jumping jacks. The ad ended with her dressed glamorously in a white sweater, sunglasses, and earings, as she got into the passenger seat of a car. Jennifer shared a photo giving a better look of the pink outfit on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story and asked fans to tell her what they’re “more than.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In a voiceover, Jennifer spoke about refusing to compromise and being able to contain multitudes. “Today I want to talk about evolving, about breaking out of whatever box you’re put in, because I know I’m more than just one thing, and I refuse to stay in my line. So just remember that. What are you more than? You can be it all you know. You can be anything you want,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jennifer-lopez-workout-video-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The campaign for BODYARMOR isn’t the only one that J.Lo has participated in recently. She’s also the star of the “Feel The Wonder” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>campaign for Coach</a>, and photos showing her looking gorgeous in some cozy-looking winter-wear were released in November. “It’s almost time to feel the wonder,” she wrote in the caption for the photos on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Aside from the ad, J.Lo has been gearing up to release her next album&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>This is Me…Now.</a>&nbsp;She announced the followup to her 2002 classic&nbsp;This Is Me&nbsp;at the end of November, and it’s sure to be an exciting album for fans, especially after she tied the knot with<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Ben Affleck</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The record even contains a sequel to her song “Dear Ben,” now that they’ve rekindled their romance and gotten married. Perhaps while she was showing off moves with a microphone in the ad, she was also gearing up for some live performances surrounding the new record? We can only hope!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49vZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWverS8zqurrGWSp65urs6dsJqqnaS%2FbrzRqKSoZaaesaa7jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
