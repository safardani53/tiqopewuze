The original show&nbsp;starred <strong><a href=#>Josh&nbsp;Radnor</a>, <a href=#>Neil Patrick Harris</a>, <a href=#>Cobie Smulders</a>, <a href=#>Alyson Hannigan </a></strong>and <strong><a href=#>Jason Segel</a>,</strong> with the late&nbsp;<a href=#>Bob Saget</a> serving as narrator.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The controversial series</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;finale sparked instant debate among viewers, who waited nearly a decade for the reveal of Ted’s (Radnor) wife. While watching the main character tie the knot with&nbsp;Tracy McConnell, portrayed by <a href=#><strong>Cristin Milioti</strong></a>, left fans feeling hopeful, the last-minute reveal of her death and Ted’s eventual reconciliation with ex-girlfriend Robyn (Smulders) <a href=#>sparked outrage from those who felt</a> the Ted and Robyn love story was best left in the past. (The pair&nbsp;got&nbsp;together at the end of season 1 but&nbsp;called&nbsp;it quits due to wanting different things in life.)&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>How I Met Your Father, which is helmed by showrunners <strong>Isaac Aptaker</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Berger,</strong> stars <a href=#><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a> as lead Sophie and follows a whole new generation of 30-somethings as they navigate life and love. While the show includes <a href=#>endless nods</a></span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;to the original series, it’s also paved its own story.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The writers, for their part, have kept the physical appearance of Sophie’s son under wraps to avoid giving&nbsp;anything&nbsp;away about the identity of the father among the diverse cast. A&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>finite list of who the father could be&nbsp;was introduced&nbsp;in the pilot: Jesse (<strong>Chris Lowell</strong>), Ian (<strong>Daniel Augustin</strong>), Charlie (<strong>Tom Ainsley</strong>), Drew (<a href=#><strong>Josh Peck</strong></a>) or Sid (<strong>Suraj Sharma</strong>).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“We have a very loose plan of the ending. We obviously come from the&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Us&nbsp;</a>world,” Berger told <a href=#>Variety</a> in March 2022</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>, referring to the beloved NBC drama. “So we’ve learned over the last almost full six seasons how important it is to have sort of the big moves of your plan mapped up out while still leaving yourself the room and the freedom to pivot or to push a little bit from what you expected. We really are people that have locked into the importance of having a plan, and we definitely have one as we go forward.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Sophie and Jesse’s immediate chemistry sparked speculation that he would be the&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Robyn to her Ted,&nbsp;the show has slowly diverted away from the pair’s romantic tension and introduced <a href=#>opportunities for new possible endings</a> — with viewers questioning&nbsp;whether&nbsp;Sid might be Sophie’s true match.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Sid&nbsp;married&nbsp;wife Hannah (<strong>Ashley Reyes</strong>) in season 2,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the two are living on opposite sides of the country and are constantly at odds about their future. Meanwhile, little moments between Sid and Sophie <a href=#>have bonded the duo in meaningful ways&nbsp;</a>throughout the series&nbsp;— including Sid being there for Sophie when she was in search of her own father.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In March 2022, Sharma opened up about what it’s like sharing the screen with an icon like Duff.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“When I was a kid I had watched&nbsp;Lizzie Mc</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Guire<i class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</i>with my brother and my sister at home coming back from school,” he told&nbsp;<a href=#>Mashable India</a>&nbsp;at the time. “So definitely,&nbsp;I was a fan. Hilary is such a sweet, kind and genuine human being. It’s really nice to know one can&nbsp;live&nbsp;the life she has lived and gone through things and still come out sane and normal.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Keep scrolling for all the best fan theories on why Sid might be the father:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BstbB5yKxkraCVYrOiwMeeqWannmK1sMOMomSmnaRixrDB0WadmqyYmr9urculZK2glWKwrcHErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
