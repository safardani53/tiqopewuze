I think maybe because of where I was raised, I was raised Lutheran and there was an aspect of right and wrong.</p><p>“I internalised, just societally, a lot of things that I felt guilty about or ashamed of.</p><p>“The past few years of my life — and Bella is no small part of that — has been questioning why I believe those things.”</p><p>Emma has always praised her <a href=#>parents, company chief executive Jeff and housewife Krista</a>, for being so supportive of her <a href=#>Hollywood </a>dreams.</p><p>But there were limits to how far she was willing to go to be a success.</p><p>Even in the adult-themed movies such as Superbad in 2007, Friends With Benefits in 2011 and 2014’s Birdman, she kept the barriers up.</p><p>She explained: “My dad would kill me if I posed naked. He wouldn’t speak to me again and I really love my dad, so that’s always something that makes me a little nervous.”</p><p>All that changed when the <a href=#>Spider-Man</a> star worked with Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos for the first time.</p><p>She signed up for his 2018 movie The Favourite, alongside <a href=#>Olivia Colman</a>, and there was no nudity for her in the script.</p><p>Then suddenly during the shoot Emma asked the director if she could appear naked in one of the bedroom scenes.</p><p>Olivia told her, “No, don’t do it,” but Emma felt it made sense for the story and went ahead.</p><p>Having taken that risk once, the star is taking on even more in Yorgos’s latest dark <a href=#>comedy</a>.</p><p>The Greek director is known for making mind-bending movies — including 2015’s The Lobster, starring <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>.</p><p>In Poor Things, based on a novel of the same name by the late Scottish author <a href=#>Alasdair Gray,</a> doctor Godwin Baxter (<a href=#>Willem Dafoe</a>) brings Bella back to life. She is betrothed to the scientist’s assistant but runs off with Ruffalo’s lothario.</p><p>Bella, who starts off with the mind of a child, must learn how to get along in what is a bizarre version of Victorian <a href=#>London</a>.</p><p>Knowing no boundaries of a normal existence, she punches and kicks people with little reason.</p><p>In the bedroom she also chooses to explore what is possible.</p><p>Emma says: “Sex is one aspect of Bella’s experiencing of everything, because there’s travel, there’s dance, there’s food, there’s <a href=#>politics</a>, there’s the concept of <a href=#>money</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000867522168.jpg><p>“But with sex, with the discovery of pleasure, I think it’s purely pleasure at the beginning and then it evolves.”</p><p>After sleeping with Duncan for the first time, Bella asks: “Why do people not do this all of the time?”</p><p>The characters then proceed to get it on so much he is left worn out.</p><p>Poor Things includes full frontal nudity, plenty of swearing and lots of what Bella calls “furious jumping”.</p><p>This likely won’t go down well with <a href=#>Gen Z</a> film-goers after a survey this year revealed that nearly half of them don’t think sex is justified in most films or <a href=#>TV </a>shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Asking actors to strip off has been described as exploitative, and intimacy co-ordinators are&nbsp;now&nbsp;hired to make sure all involved are comfortable with what is going on when filming.</p><p>Mark Ruffalo, though, is worried things have gone too far.</p><p>The 56-year-old star said in a recent interview: “I think it’s gotten a bit prudish and like a new Victorian age.”&nbsp;</p><p>Certainly the Victorians, who insisted on even ankles being covered up, would be shocked by the raunchy film.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the more debauched of them might recognise the activities viewers witness in the brothel scenes.</p><p>Yorgos, 50, defended the X-rated nature of some of the material.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Dynamics in sex’</h2><p>He said: “It would feel very disingenuous to tell this story about this character who is so free and so open, and then&nbsp;to&nbsp;be a prude about the sexual aspect of it.”</p><p>Poor Things isn’t simply a comic romp — it makes strong points about the way women are treated.</p><p>Bella realises that men like Duncan can be self-centred and controlling.</p><p>Emma explains: “She’s learning about all these different dynamics in sex and <span id=d643adc3-04ef-4c1b-8c06-d7e79064c6f0 class=suggested-link>power</span> and what it means. I think it’s just a hugely important part of her growth and development, as I think it is for all of us in life.”</p><p>Mark and Emma spent three weeks rehearsing so they were unabashed once the cameras started rolling.</p><p>That level of ease is very different to what young Emma experienced.</p><p>She lived with such crippling anxiety that she asked to be home-schooled at the age of 12.</p><p>But acting helped her overcome those fears — and playing Bella went much, much further.</p><p>She explains&nbsp;of the character:&nbsp;“She lives without shame or self-judgment or even really judgment of others.&nbsp;It was very freeing.”</p><p>Most famous people are subject to media attention on their <a href=#>dating</a> lives but Emma largely kept her romances out of the spotlight when she fell for co-stars <a href=#>Kieran Culkin,</a> from 2013’s Movie 43, and <a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a>, who she met filming Spider-Man and dated for four years before they split in 2015.</p><p>She is now married to American comedian <a href=#>Dave McCary</a>, 38.&nbsp;They tied the knot in 2020 and their daughter <a href=#>Louise Jean</a> was born in March 2021.</p><p>As she gets older Emma, who at the age of 14 put together a PowerPoint presentation for her parents detailing how she would make it in acting, is learning to worry less about doing things wrong.</p><p>She concludes: “Instead of shame, what about leaning into it and apologising and saying, ‘I’m human and there was an error’.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“So yeah, it’s definitely made me think about the nature of shame quite a lot.”</p><ul><li>Poor Things arrives in cinemas on January 12.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-released-summit-entertainment-shows-262734331.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/user-expressly-acknowledges-agrees-downloading-635851589.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/actress-emma-stone-dad-jeff-868386269.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGplZoN4fpVxZp6lnZZ6tMDOp5xmqJ%2Bkv27Ax6KloKtdrXqzrdOem2aemaG6cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
