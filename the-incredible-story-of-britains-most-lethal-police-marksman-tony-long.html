A third armed robber was also shot but survived.</p><p>Describing how he took out Flynn he says: “I remembered seeing his eyes through the slot of his balaclava as I fired.</p><p>“The other two were also starting to turn and bring their weapons to bear so I’d had to start shooting or it might have been me waiting on a slab for the pathologist’s knife.</p><p>“My rounds had hit him (Flynn) in the back, tough. This was big boys’ rules, he should’ve stuck to shoplifting.” An inquest found the two crooks had been killed lawfully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000246710576.jpg><p>The next time Tony killed, in April 2005, it took far longer to prove he had made the right decision.</p><p>He spent ten years clearing his name after shooting dead suspected gangster Azelle Rodney, 24, in April 2005.</p><p>The officer was part of the Met’s CO19 firearms unit called in after a tip-off that a British gang intended to rob Colombian drug dealers. Tony’s team was told the Brits were armed with MAC-10 sub-machine guns.</p><p>The cops soon found themselves in a car chasing Rodney’s VW Golf along a road in Mill Hill, North London.</p><p>Tony swung into action when he thought he saw Rodney reach for a weapon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000246710345.jpg><p>He writes: “He was armed, I was certain of it! He’d picked up the heavy, box-like MAC-10 and was readying himself to fire.</p><p>“I held my breath as I aligned my iron sights on his centre mass, my finger curled around the trigger.</p><p>“No more time. I was going to have to shoot him and I was going to have to do it now. At any second my colleagues would be on foot and vulnerable. No time to shout a warning!”</p><p>Tony fired eight times through the Golf’s open window at close range, killing Rodney instantly.</p><p>As ambulance crews attempted in vain to save the suspect, Tony writes that he looked on, thinking: “A life wasted through reckless, selfish, greed. I was starting to feel angry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000172922328.jpg><p>“Angry at a nameless corpse going cold in a suburban London street. The body of a young, stupid gangster who had forced me into killing, again.”</p><p>A search of the suspect’s car then revealed three firearms inside but none was an automatic and only one was loaded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000176343967.jpg><p>And few days later Long admitted that, on reflection, he was just assuming that Rodney had picked up the weapon, rather than actually seeing it.</p><p>In a full written statement at the time he explained: “Everything about his actions and his body language led me to believe that he had picked up a firearm and was preparing to shoot a fully automatic firearm but I still couldn’t see a weapon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000246710567.jpg><p>A lengthy public inquiry, chaired by retired High Court judge Sir Christopher Holland, eventually ruled that Tony had acted unlawfully. As a result, Tony was charged with murder and stood trial.</p><p>He was finally found not guilty by a jury last year.</p><p>Despite the saga, and expressing sympathy for the dead man’s family, Tony writes: “I’d not lost a moment’s sleep over Rodney’s death.</p><p>“Rodney wasn’t Stephen Lawrence, he was a violent gangster already wanted for a double stabbing.”</p><p>But he has sometimes wished he had never come clean in his statement about not having actually seen Rodney with a gun.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>He writes: “In in my darker moments, I have laid awake wondering whether it might not have been a lot simpler to have simply said that I’d seen that gun in Rodney’s hand.</p><p>“Thinking of what my family and I had been put through, I sometimes thought that perhaps, honesty wasn’t always the best policy.”</p><p>Tony, who grew up in Sussex, joined the Metropolitan Police in 1975. He later did a five-day firearms training course, and after scoring 100 per cent in the accuracy test, he joined the Met’s firearms unit in 1983.</p><p>Two years later, on Christmas Day 1985, he was involved in his first shooting. Errol Walker had fatally stabbed his ex-wife’s step-sister in her flat in Northolt, West London, then barricaded himself inside holding her daughter Karlene, four, at knifepoint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000246710511.jpg><p>Walker, 30, cut the little girl’s arm to the bone and let her blood drip out the window on firefighters waiting below in case he dropped her.</p><p>Eventually the order was given for Tony and his team to storm the flat.<br>He writes: “As I started to fire he plunged the knife into the little girl.</p><p>“I fired a double tap, my muzzle blast lighting the room and silhouetting my sights. I knew from his reaction that I’d hit him.”</p><p>Walker survived and was sentenced to life for murder. Tony was commended for bravery — one of seven such commendations he picked up in his often illustrious 33-year career.</p><p>He was part of the squad that dressed up as cleaners to foil a daring heist of De Beers diamonds worth £350million on show at London’s Millennium Dome in 2000. It led to this Sun headline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000003933299.jpg><p>But he admits he never felt secure enough in his job not to have back-up plans in place.</p><p>He reveals how he and a colleague collected a “Marmite file” — named after a TV advert at the time that said “my mate Marmite” — of incriminating information on supervisors.</p><p>Tony says: “The idea was that if you found yourself in a corner with no way out, you’d pull out the file and before revealing what you had on them, would say, ‘You don’t want to sack me, sir. I’m your mate’.</p><p>“Our file was bulging with misdemeanours and f***-ups. Some might consider it blackmail, we preferred to call it insurance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000246710336.jpg><p>Tony was also awarded £5,000 compensation after Sue Akers, then Met’s Internal Affairs Commander, jokingly called him “the Met’s very own serial killer” in 2005 after the Rodney case.</p><p>The incident highlighted conflicting attitudes towards armed police officers even within the Met.</p><p>Tony writes: “In a police service proud to boast that it is predominantly unarmed, those that volunteer to carry firearms have always been looked upon as its b*****d sons and daughters.</p><p>“Still the stigma remains.”</p><p><strong>Extracts from Lethal Force: My Life As the Met’s Most Controversial Marksman, published by Ebury, out now at £16.99. © Tony Long 2016.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoF1gpdtaGismJp6qrrCq5ydoZKhsm6%2F06ipsmWfm3qjvsitmKKmo2K6sL%2FTZqOerJiWuW68zqWgnJ1doq6zt9KmmKdlpKS7unnLqKWgZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
