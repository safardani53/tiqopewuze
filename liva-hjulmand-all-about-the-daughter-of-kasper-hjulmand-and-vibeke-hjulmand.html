The little girl is reared with two elder siblings. Marcus is the name of her oldest brother, in increasing order. Marcus is eleven years her senior.&nbsp;Mikkel, her second brother, is named after her. He is in his adolescence and is seven years older than Liva. Mikkel is also a participant.

Then there’s Liva, the family’s youngest member.</p><h2>After their marriage, how long have Kasper and Vibeke been together?</h2><p>The precise date of their formal marriage ceremony is unknown. They have, however, been together since 1992. It’s been over three decades since the duo has had each other’s back. Kasper and Vibeke met for the first time in Folk High School. It has been said that they are having a happy life. The couple and their children have relocated to Allerod, which is situated in North Zealand. Kasper’s wedding is kept under wraps.&nbsp;As of this writing, there are few specifics about their wedding. Kasper seems to want to keep his personal life out of the spotlight. As a result, nothing is known about his complete family. Without a doubt, Kasper has skillfully kept a low-profile existence.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Liva-Hjulmand-3.jpg alt="Liva Hjulmand" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>A sneak peeks into Kasper Hjulmand’s early career.</h2><p>Kasper is widely regarded as one of Denmark’s most prominent and popular football figures.
