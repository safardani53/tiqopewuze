"I feel grateful that I survived it all."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in Buenos Aires and raised in London, Hussey was just 15 years old when she nabbed the coveted role of Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's film, which became an international hit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So much happened so fast," says Hussey. "It was overnight superstardom and I wasn't prepared for it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Overwhelmed by the fame and attention, Hussey took a step back and focused on her budding relationship with Christopher Jones, a young actor whom she had met through her agent, Rudi Altobelli.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Coral Von Zumwalt</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But soon after they began dating, Jones began to abuse her. "We were talking and his eyes glazed over and he punched me in the stomach," Hussey says. The physical and emotional abuse continued, but Hussey stuck by him. "I was young, and I loved him," she says. "I was very loyal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Around the same time, Hussey recalls her brief conversation with a pregnant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sharon Tate</a>, who, along with her husband, Roman Polanski, was renting the Los Angeles home of Altobelli in the summer of 1969.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said to Sharon, 'Rudy said we're going to be best friends,'" Hussey says of their phone call. "She told me, 'I'm so looking forward to meeting you, my baby is coming soon.' She was so sweet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hussey was planning to move to Los Angeles and into the guest house. "I was going to stay there and I'd get to help Sharon with the baby," she says. "Then Rudi got the call."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The call was to deliver the shocking news that Tate, along with four others, was murdered at Altobelli's home on August 9 while he was away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'll never forget Rudi telling me," says Hussey. "He said, 'They're all dead.' It was terrible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But just five weeks after the murders, Hussey, who had summoned up the courage to break up with Jones, moved into the house.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People would say, 'How could you live there?'" she says. "I'd say, 'In England, most of the houses have horrible memories. It's not that big of a deal.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Says Hussey: "All I felt was Sharon's vibration. And it was lovely. She'd left an orange scarf and I kept it on my prayer table for years."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Everett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Hussey's own nightmare had yet to happen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One night, Jones showed up at the house and brutally attacked and raped her. "I didn't know if he was going to kill me," says Hussey. "My face was like a balloon. I had a bloody nose, my lip was split open, and I had a black eye. It was terrifying."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Weeks later, Hussey, who told very few people about the attack (Jones died in 2014), discovered she was pregnant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I decided I could not have the baby," she writes in the book of having a subsequent abortion. "It broke my heartâ€¦although I have never regretted it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Hussey says now that the silver lining was falling in love with her future husband, Dean Paul Martin, the son of singer Dean Martin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I fell for him because of the way he treated me and took care of me," says Hussey. The couple wed in 1971 and had one son, Alex, now 45. They split in 1979 but remained close friends until his tragic death in a plane crash in 1987.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hussey had another son, 35-year-old Max, with her second husband, Japanese singer Akira Fuse, before meeting her current husband of 29 years, rocker David Glen Eisley, with whom she has a daughter India, 24.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone has their issues and their problems," Hussey says of getting through dark times. "But I'm so happy to be where I am now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0mimpaGmnq5utNSsqp6xXaeyt7HApapmq5iaerit0mapmqiVmXqquoytn55lk52us7jErGSmmZ6ovK95zK6pnZ2iYrWwucRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
