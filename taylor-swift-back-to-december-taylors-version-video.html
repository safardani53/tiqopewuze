The 33-year-old took to Twitter to release the re-recorded song along with the show’s trailer. “Crying (Taylor’s Version),” she jokingly captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the clip</a>. The original song was released in 2010 and was featured on her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>album&nbsp;Speak Now</a>, which will have a re-release come Jul. 7.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Crying (Taylor’s Version) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/hVPrQuRAkH</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June 30, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Soon after the song was released in the trailer, many Swifties took to the reply section of her tweet to react to getting the single one week before the album drops. “NO IM CRYING HELLO?!”, one fan jokingly <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>replied</a> to the songstress, while another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>added</a>, “LITERALLY CRYING!” Many of the blonde beauty’s fans also took to the comments section of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>show’s tweet</a> of the trailer to gush over the hit song. “I’M ALREADY SOBBING AND I’VE REWATCHED THIS TOO MANY TIMES,” one admirer <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>quipped</a>, while another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>, “Not back to December,” along with crying emojis.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As Swifties know, the track was originally written with Taylor’s ex&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong></a>, 31, in mind. The&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;star confirmed this was true during a 2016 interview with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lea Michele</a>&nbsp;</strong>and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> John Stamos </strong></a>(<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>watch here</a>). Swift and Lautner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dated briefly</a> in 2009 after they met on the set of the movie&nbsp;Valentine’s Day that same year. In the song, she belts out the lyrics “I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile / So good to me, so right,” which are about the 31-year-old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-Swift-Back-To-December-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although they broke up, he still supports his ex’s music and even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hilariously reacted</a> to the album announcement with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok video</a> on May 17. In Lautner’s video, he got down on his knees and joked that he was going to “Pray” for Swift’s ex,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>, 45, who she famously wrote the song “Dear John” about on the 2010 album. “I think it’s a great album. Yeah, I feel safe,” the Hollywood hunk told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY.com</a> at the time. “Praying for John.” Lautner has since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>moved on</a> and married&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Dome</strong></a> in 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Swift made the Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) album announcement during her Nashville <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eras Tour&nbsp;</a>show on May 5. When the “Anti-Hero” hitmaker took to the stage, she told her Swifties that she had been “planning something for a while.” She debuted the announcement with the album’s cover art on a jumbotron behind her (watch <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>). “I plot I scheme I plan…. I think rather than me like speaking about it I thought I would just show you, so if you would direct your attention to the back big screen,” Taylor gushed.
