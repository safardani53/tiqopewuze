<a href=#>each bringing in 13 players</a>.</p><p>Boehly and his cohorts focused on trawling a dragnet around the world to scoop up a raft of young players that brought the average age of the squad down to just 22.5.</p><p>But while sporting directors Paul Winstlanley and Lawrence Stewart went looking far and wide they missed the rising star right under their noses.</p><p>And <a href=#>Anthony Elanga</a> made them pay for it in the most painful sense by scoring his first goal for Forest since making a <a href=#>£15million move from Manchester United</a> in July.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS -

who came with a mission to soak it up and strike on the counter.</p><p>Any threat they did pose on the Forest goal prior to the welcome relief of the break was expertly snuffed out by the stout defending of skipper Joe Worrall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-chelseas-nicolas-jackson-shoots-841953838-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/8168cd7e-a561-488b-8bb0-145329f2beec.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-chelseas-raheem-sterling-looks-841961101.jpg><p>The skipper was a rock at the back and on top of his game because, while Chelsea lack the finishing of a top side, they do possess the youth and energy to whirl around the pitch in all directions at 200mph.</p><p>Forest picked themselves up following the <a href=#>deadline-day departure of forward Brennan Johnson to Tottenham</a>.</p><p>Johnson’s eight Premier League goals last season played a key role in keeping Steve Cooper’s side in the top flight and keeping the head coach in a job.</p><p>While Elanga grabbed the limelight with his classy finish, captain Worrall was the standout servant for the merry men of Sherwood Forest as the unsung hero at the back.</p><p>Even though Chelsea are nowhere near where they should be in front of goal, Forest’s towering centre-half still did not put a foot wrong apart from one fleeting moment at the death.</p><p>He was given the slip by Sterling who raced to the byline then cut the ball back only for Nicolas Jackson, another new recruit, to miss a sitter from three yards and sum up Chelsea’s miserable day.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Pochettino brought on <a href=#>Cole Palmer</a> and three other subs in the second half - all part of his new stable of soccer toddlers - and hardly looked like grabbing a point.</p><p>In fact, Elanga could have grabbed a second for Forest in the closing stages when he broke free along the left and smashed a shot against the post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cole-palmer-chelsea-ball-premier-841947025.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-nottingham-forests-anthony-elanga-841942698.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nottingham-forest-manager-steve-cooper-841958589.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH90g5VyaXJoX5i1prjSnphmpp%2Bpwaq6xqGYpmWWpL%2Bmv9NmmKesmKS7unnEpZinn5Fk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync -
