Congratulations to all three of them!" wrote a fourth.</p><p>"I figured it would go to @James_Holzhauer cause he's, you know, James. But wow oh wow, did @mattearoach not give him a run for his money. Brilliant." wrote a fifth.</p><p>"I think that’s the closest anyone has been or ever will be to getting James- Ken not included," wrote a sixth internet user.</p><p>"James winning on the rare conservative wager, crazy," wrote another.</p><p>"Unbelievable drama in the @Jeopardy Masters final tonight.
