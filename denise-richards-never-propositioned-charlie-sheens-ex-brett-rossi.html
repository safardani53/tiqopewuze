I don’t even watch their show, but … I felt sad that she was getting eaten alive by them.”</p><p>The model went on to allege that Richards “didn’t like me because I didn’t want to have a creepy threesome relationship with her and Charlie,” to whom the Wild Things star was married from June 2002 to November 2006. (The exes share daughters Sam, 16, and Lola, 15.)</p><p>Contrary to Rossi’s claims, a source close to Sheen exclusively tells Us Weekly, “Denise never propositioned Brett for a threesome. Denise has never even had a threesome and never had a threesome with Charlie. And she’s never propositioned any other woman in Charlie’s life.”</p><p>The AVN Award winner also claimed to CelebMagazine that Richards once “hired a hooker” for the Two and a Half Men alum and “took photos of them having sex and ‘accidentally’ sent them to Charlie knowing damn well I would find out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Denise-Richards-Never-Propositioned-Charlie-Sheen-Ex-Brett-Rossi-for-a-Threesome.jpg><p>The source, however, has a different story: “Denise didn’t send any photos like the ones Brett is describing. Never. People like Brett are jumping on the coattails of a very popular show and trying to get their name out there.”</p><p>In fact, the only time Richards ever texted Rossi was “about Charlie as a dad and keeping a relationship with his daughters” as she “didn’t want anything to affect their kids,” according to the source. Otherwise, “Denise had minimal contact with her.”</p><p>After their divorce, the Bravo personality (who <a href=#>married <strong>Aaron Phypers</strong></a> in September 2018) had “no interest romantically” in Sheen, the source tells Us. “She just wanted to be cordial and build his relationship with their daughters and have a good coparenting relationship with Charlie. But Brett was so threatened and very jealous and did everything she could to try to sabotage that.”</p><p>Rossi’s feelings toward Richards got so out of hand in the end that their mutual ex had to intervene.</p><p>“Brett slashed Denise’s tires twice. At one point, Brett wanted to take a baseball bat to Denise’s house and smash Denise in the head with it,” the source claims. “Charlie had to physically stop her.”</p><p>Rossi denies the allegations, telling&nbsp;Us, “Anyone who knows me knows I do not like confrontation. I never slashed her tires — or anyone’s tires, as a matter of fact. She would have gone to the police if I had done something so horrendous, and she would have definitely had security footage of this.” (The source close to Sheen explains, “Denise never called the police because then it would be public and she’d worry the kids would then deal about it. She’d deal with things privately.”)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second source, meanwhile, tells&nbsp;Us, “Drama is Denise’s middle name. … Denise trying to deny this thing is total bulls–t and she knows it. Those around Denise feel bad for her daughters. Charlie is very protective over his girls. He has been sober for two years and is a totally different person. Charlie doesn’t even pay attention to these type of stories.”</p><p>With reporting by Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZ6ewKZ50aKaoZmimcBuusSvnKtloKe8sbvSoquip56asW6vx5qppaGVYsCpscSnqmadqGKvs7HTrWSrp6OotnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
