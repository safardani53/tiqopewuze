His speed figures are among the best in the race and top trainer Chad Brown relies on just him so should be confident of a big run.</p><p>Favourite Essential Quality is bidding to give Godolphin their first win in this great race and it’s hard to believe that the Boys In Blue haven’t had so much as a place before.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £10 at Punchestown Get<strong> </strong>£60 in Free Bets - <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HER</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E</a></strong></p><p>T&Cs: Bet £10 on any race at Punchestown, between Tuesday 27th April – Saturday 1st May — Get £60 in racing free bets.

That early speed could be a major asset to stay out of trouble and he shapes like a stayer.</p><p>This is just his fourth run so there should be more to come.</p><p>Looking at the bigger prices, Medina Spirit looks a solid each-way bet. I’ll be splitting my stakes on him and Highly Motivated at the prices.</p><p>Bob Baffert’s hope was second in the Santa Anita Derby last time when not getting the best of runs out wide.</p><p>He is another with lots of early speed and that’s a major factor in a big field as it can be hard to come from out the back.</p><p>His times have been good and he shapes as though stepping up in distance will be the making of him.</p><h2>KENTUCKY DERBY 1-2-3</h2><li>Highly Motivated</li><li>Rock Your World</li><li>Medina Spirit</li><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FREE BETS: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></strong></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
