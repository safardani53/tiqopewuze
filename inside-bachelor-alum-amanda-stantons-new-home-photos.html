The Bachelor alum gave Us Weekly an exclusive look inside her Laguna Beach dream home, which she shares with her daughters and her boyfriend, <strong>Bobby Jacobs.</strong></p><p>“Waking up to a view of the ocean every day — you can’t really beat that,” the 28-year-old Lani the Label fashion designer gushed to Us. “We also finally have a backyard, which the girls are super excited about. I want to make the patio a nice outdoor space for summer, so we can have barbecues and eat outside. I’m going to put those string lights through the trees to make it really romantic.”</p><p>Stanton shares daughters Kinsley, 7, and Charlie, 5, with her ex-husband, <strong>Nick Buonfiglio.</strong> While the reality TV star almost found love with <a href=#><strong>Ben Higgins</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Josh Murray</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Robby Hayes</strong></a> during her time on<a href=#> The Bachelor</a> and<a href=#> Bachelor in Paradise,</a> she feels confident that Jacobs, 33, is The One for her.</p><p>“After my last couple relationships, I was so discouraged,” she admitted to Us. “I also had this feeling like, ‘OK, I’m 28 and I’m single. But I also have two kids, so I’m in no hurry to find someone.’ When Bobby and I first started dating, I bailed on him a few times, because dating wasn’t really a priority for me. But as soon as we met, I instantly liked him.”</p><p>Stanton added that the Tillow cofounder is “so sweet and genuine.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He doesn’t say stuff he doesn’t mean, and after being with so many guys who just tell me what I want to hear, that set him apart,” she told Us.</p><p>For more from Stanton, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!
