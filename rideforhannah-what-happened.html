However, they were halfway through an equitation class when the horse unexpectedly “planted its left front hoof, causing the horse to lean down towards its left front hoof,” according to the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office. Hannah took a “rotational fall” in front of the horse. The horse also suffered a rotational fall and landed on Hannah, immediately sending her to the hospital with severe injuries. Hannah didn’t survive the fall and died later. The horse wasn't injured during the accident.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Hannah and her horse weren't jumping at the time of the accident. Reports haven’t been shared if Hannah wore a helmet while riding. However, the competition was recognized by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USEF (U.S. Equestrian Federation)</a>, and the USEF has required all riders to wear a helmet while mounted on the competition grounds since 2012. But due to the horse’s weight, Hannah likely would’ve succumbed to her injuries with or without a helmet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following Hannah’s death, the rising equestrian received multiple condolences from other riders and those who followed her career. Soon, the hashtag #RideForHannah scattered across social media, bringing more awareness to Hannah’s incident on platforms like Instagram.</p><p>In May 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allison Moynihan</a>, a fellow equestrian community member, introduced the hashtag to her followers and shared its importance.</p><p>“As many of you have heard, our fellow equestrian Hannah Serfass tragically lost her life on April 30th while competing,” Allison said on Instagram under a photo of Hannah. “ On behalf of her parents and trainer, Robin Swinderman Mitchell, we would like to show our love and support for Hannah and her passion for horses by tagging <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#rideforhannah</a> on social media.”</p><p>“We hope to give some support to her family and friends during this extremely difficult time, so let’s come together as a community and show our love for Hannah,” the post continued.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hannah Sefrass’s parents said the 15-year-old “died doing the thing she absolutely loved.”</h2><p>Several days after the hashtag #rideforhannah surfaced, a fellow equestrian, Kate Egan, created a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe page to honor Hannah</a>. The GoFundMe quickly exceeded its $10,000 goal for Hannah to have a memorial at one of her favorite places — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World Equestrian Center-Ocala </a>in Florida.</p><p>The WEC-Ocala memorial will coincide with a smaller tribute to Hannah with her personal loved ones.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The outpouring of support from the equestrian community is something Hannah’s parents, Janine and David Serfass, didn’t see coming initially. After reflecting on their daughter’s short but impactful life, they expressed gratitude for the community.</p><p>“Our daughter died doing the thing she absolutely loved the most in this world,” they said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chronicle of the Horse</a>. “If from this tragedy, one person can be saved and find God. Then her death will not be in vain.”</p><p>“We are deeply touched by all of the love and prayers everyone has sent us during this very difficult time,” they continued. “It means the world to us to every person who has taken the time to reach out or post something in Hannah’s honor. We cherish seeing the #rideforhannah campaign and those chosen to dress in her favorite color, azure blue. We thank you again from the bottom of our hearts! God Bless.”</p><p>To donate to Hannah’s GoFundMe, click the link <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7alscWoqaGZnqOuqXnWoZitZZiWvbGxzZ6b</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
