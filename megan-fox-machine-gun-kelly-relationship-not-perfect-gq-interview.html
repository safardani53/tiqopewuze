I didn’t say it was the darkest fairy tale for no reason. God help you if you would’ve met us last Saturday.”&nbsp;Megan agreed with her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rockstar beau</a>‘s sentiments about their romance, telling British&nbsp;GQ Style, “There’s also the demonic side.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/megan-fox-machine-gun-kelly-gq-style-british-embed02.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Megan stripped down in nothing but a black bra and underwear for part of the&nbsp;shoot. The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexy superstar</a> sat on a black couch while holding up a gun to MGK, who wore an oversized black jacket, leather pants and boots. The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Bloody Valentine” singer</a>&nbsp;also had a cigarette in his mouth, and a snippet of his tattoos were slightly visible on his chest.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>For more professional snapshots, Megan wore a gold minidress. Her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stunning black hair</a> lightly flowed as she posed with MGK, who this time around, went completely shirtless to give fans a look at his tattoo-filled body. The couple <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packed on plenty of PDA</a> for the photoshoot, which is pretty routine for the pair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/megan-fox-machine-gun-kelly-gq-style-british-embed03.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Elsewhere in the interview, Megan and MGK reflected on how they fell in love on the set of the movie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Midnight In The Switchgrass</a>&nbsp;early last year. “It was obvious from second one what it was going to be, but we didn’t hook up right away,” Megan recalled of the relationship. The actress later added, “I was definitely open [to] love, but I did not anticipate walking right into my soulmate like that. I was obviously <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>over the way I had been living</a>, and those paths lined up, those doors opened. It was [as if] all the obstacles that had kept us apart all those years [had been removed] and we were able to finally intersect.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BqZqadl5a7brLOsWSmmZOdtq%2BxjKCsp2WbmrmtxYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmpp%2BperGx0Z%2BcnKxdnL5utc2tnKuumZrEcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
