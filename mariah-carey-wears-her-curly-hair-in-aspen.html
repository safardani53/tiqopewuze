Her coily crown was styled in a shaggy but distressed half-up half-down ‘do that was parted to one side — reminiscent of a look she rocked in the ‘90s.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Carey previously <a href=#>opened up about her natural hair</a> in conversation with<strong> Meghan Markle</strong> during an August 2022 episode of the Duchess of Sussex’s former “Archetypes” podcast. While Carey’s locks have served as inspiration for years, she told Markle, 42, that she was met with adversity growing up because “nobody” knew what to do with her hair when she was little. (Carey’s mother, <strong>Patricia Carey</strong>, is white and her father, Alfred Carey — who died in 2002 — was Black.)</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I think sometimes when it’s the other way around, you get the benefits of someone who’s dealt with textured hair,” Carey said, seemingly implying that it may be a bit easier for a biracial child if the mother is Black.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Mariah-Carey-Brings-Back-90s-Hair2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>On Wednesday, Carey teamed her curly mane with an all-black getup that included a black velour, star-adorned tracksuit. She styled the set with retro leg warmers and of course, glossy platform heels. (Carey revealed during a November appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show that heels are always her shoe of choice and she doesn’t own any sneakers or flats.)&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Carey’s trip to Aspen comes amid confirmation that she and longtime boyfriend <strong>Bryan Tanaka</strong> <a href=#>have split</a>.
