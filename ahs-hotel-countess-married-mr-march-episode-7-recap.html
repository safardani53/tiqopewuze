So, how did they get there? Well, she began sleeping with a power couple in 1925 — Rudolph Valentino (also played by <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Finn Wittrock</a></strong>!)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Natacha Rambova. I mean, threesomes and threeway dance offs? Yes please. However, during the Cortez opening party, she found out Valentino was dead — and&nbsp;Mr. March&nbsp;comforted her when she tried to commit suicide.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-18-at-11-13-44-pm.png alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-18 at 11.13.44 PM" width=532 height=313 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, she later found out Valentino&nbsp;faked his death as he turned immortal, and he and his wife invited her to run away with them. However, Mr. March found out, knocked them out, then locked them out — literally, confined them inside the brick walls in a&nbsp;hidden section of the Cortez. You actually saw that wall once before, in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>episode two when his wife saw him</a> putting up bricks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In present day, Mr. March revealed to the Countess what he did to her lovers — and that with Will Drake redoing the hotel, he cut through all the walls — and they were let out. After feeding on some of the hotel guests, they left the hotel, looking as good as they did 100 years ago. And the Countess was&nbsp;not happy.&nbsp;<img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Det. Lowe Hits A New Low</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, Det. Lowe let himself be admitted into a hospital, since it was the one listed on the suspect’s file he saw&nbsp;when attacking his co-worker. He was desperate to find the suspect in the murder files: Andrew Hahn. Instead, he found Ren, a creepy little girl who was an accomplice in the murders — which included nailing someone’s tongue to a table. Yes, really. She was actually turned by&nbsp;the Countess.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>He made a deal with her that he would help her break out of the hospital if she would bring him to the killer. After doing so, she runs into traffic. So, there’s that. My theory? Det. Lowe is the serial killer and he’s blacking out before murdering these people.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What’d you think this week,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>— Emily Longeretta</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH5ye5BxZpqgo2K1sMDEpWScp6Wjwaa%2F0makmqqinrKlecyrZKaZopi1brHPoqqonJVihG6%2BxJyYqWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
