She got fat and not phat."</p><p>And instead of replying with another comment, she made an entire video about it.</p><p>In that video, she took her shirt off and did a little dance in a sports bra while posting some stats: she claimed that she’s 5’0.5" tall, she wears a size 6, and she weighs 145 pounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"You guys make it easy to make you look dumb," she concluded at the end.</p><p>But funnily enough, a lot of her followers didn’t believe her.</p><p>"Ain’t no way sis," one person told her.</p><p>"I’m 5 feet and 135 and wear a size 11 lmao," another person wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"You ain’t no size 6 another lie I guess," read one comment — someone replied to that and speculated "I think she meant 16."</p><p>So many comments were like this, saying that she must be lying and listing their own heights, weights and sizes to show that she must not be telling the truth.</p><p>Lots of people asked her to step on a scale and post a video of it, and others wanted a closet tour so that they could see the tags on her clothing.</p><p>Her followers made so many comments like this that she made an additional video explaining that when she was younger, she always weighed 115-120 pounds, and that when she was working out a lot, she weighed even less.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Because of this, and because she’s so short, going up to 145 pounds "is actually gaining a lot of weight for my body."</p><p>She also said that while she does have some fat in her stomach area, a lot of that weight gain is muscle, and she doesn’t "give a sh-t" if you believe that or not.</p><p>And, as it turned out, a lot of people still don’t believe her.</p><p>The thing is, and it’s so weird that this even has to be explained, is that different people carry their weight in different ways, and everyone’s body is different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s so hard to just look at someone and say exactly how much they weigh and exactly what size clothing they wear, and also it just really doesn’t matter.</p><p>Sure, Jenelle has <a href=#>a habit of lying about all kinds of things</a>, but if she really is lying about this … who really cares?</p><p>There are like a million more interesting conversations to be had about this woman and why she is the way she is — why not just focus on all of that instead of her body?</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -
