The risk to the wider public is very low.</p><p>“If any close contacts are not fully vaccinated against diphtheria, their vaccinations should be boosted. Completing the course of vaccinations remains the most effective way for people to protect themselves against becoming ill with diphtheria.”</p><p>Over the past decade, the number of cases in England has climbed from an average of two to 11 per year, excluding 2020.</p><p>Diphtheria is a serious and highly contagious infection spread by cough, sneezes or close contact.</p><p>It was one of the major causes of death during in the Victorian times but is now relatively rare because children have been routinely vaccinated since the 1940s.</p><p>However, the number of <a href=#>teenagers</a>&nbsp;receiving their booster - given at age 14 -&nbsp;<a href=#>fell by seven per cent per cent last year</a>.</p><p>Those who are unvaccinated are highly susceptible to the bug, which can also cause nasty ulcers on the skin, if it's not treated with&nbsp;<a href=#>antibiotics</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Since 2018, the&nbsp;<a href=#>World Health Organisation</a>&nbsp;(WHO) has reported a rise in cases in places such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Indonesia</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>India</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>South American</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Africa</a>.</p><p>Wigmore Primary School have not responded to request for comment.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">The 7 symptoms of diphtheria you need to know:</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>SIGNS of the serious illness usually start two to five days after you become infected.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>NHS&nbsp;</a>says the key symptoms include:</p><li>a thick grey-white coating that may cover the back of your throat, nose and tongue</li><li>a high temperature (fever)</li><li>sore throat</li><li>swollen glands in your neck</li><li>difficulty breathing and swallowing</li><li>pus-filled blisters on your legs, feet and hands</li><li>large ulcers surrounded by red, sore looking skin</li><p>Since 2018, the&nbsp;<a href=#>World Health Organization&nbsp;</a>(WHO) has reported a rise in cases in places such as Indonesia, India, South American and Africa.</p><p>It's spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected.</p><p>You can, however, also get it from sharing items such as cups, clothing or bedding with an infected person.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgY9ranFrYWSwor%2FEZp%2Bin5ihxm6vzqermp%2BZpMK0ecOiqp6Zo5p6pLvNn6CrpZWZera3jKyaoaefoXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
