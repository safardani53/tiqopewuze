They were also quite intrigued&nbsp;by <span>Chumlee’s changed physical appearance</span>—how he lost weight, his ultimate goal, and his weight loss journey.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Chumlee Began His Weight Loss Journey Due to Family Uncertainty&nbsp;</h2><p>The TV star has struggled with his weight all his life and wanted to get in shape. As the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 38-year-old started his weight loss journey in 2013 when he lost his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">father</a>&nbsp;to Pancreatic Cancer. Chumlee didn't want to have the same fate as his father. So, he started going to the gym and eating&nbsp;a well-balanced diet. He&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span>excluded red meat, all the junk, and processed food (except mustard) from his diet.</span></p><p><span>The result?&nbsp;He&nbsp;lost 75lbs in a year! Check out the before and after weight loss photos below!&nbsp;</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/Chumlee-before-and-after-weight-loss.jpg><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Unfortunately, he couldn’t maintain the weight for an extended period despite eating clean and working out. In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pop Culture</a>, Chumlee&nbsp;opened up about his weight loss battle, which<span>&nbsp;affected </span>him his whole life, due to which he opted for the next route—surgery. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I've been down, I've been up, I've been down, I've been up. So, when you need a little help to stay down, this is where you come.</p><h2>How Did Chumlee Lose Weight?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span>In January 2019, it seemed like the TV star had made a new year resolution to take&nbsp;his health seriously and was all set to create a unique journey once again with total dedication and enthusiasm.&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>One of the more&nbsp;drastic measures he took to get back in shape was getting a&nbsp;</span>Gastric Sleeve Surgery<span> done in Blossom Bariatrics at Warm Springs Surgical Center in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Before the procedure, Chumlee weighed 342 lbs, but he lost 38 lbs just on a pre-operation diet. A week later, he was down to 230 lbs, thanks to the surgery he opted for.</p><p><span>His ultimate goal was to be under 200lbs—so, he followed the&nbsp;diet recommended to him by the doctors for three more weeks. As a result, it eventually got him close to what he had aimed for as his final weight after the whole procedure was&nbsp;down to 212lbs.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So, how much weight did Chumlee lose in total? As per an exclusive report from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> published on October 10, 2021, the reality star was at a relatively slim 190 lbs. He lost 160 pounds in an attempt to not just get healthy&nbsp;but stay healthy.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Chumlee Was Inspired by His Best Friend to Stay Fit&nbsp;</h2><p>In an interview in 2014, Chumlee&nbsp;shared&nbsp;that he had been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inspired to</a> lose weight by his childhood best friend and <a href=# rel=follow>Pawn Stars</a> co-star Corey Harrison.&nbsp;Harrison was also overweight at that moment and was on his journey to stay fit.</p><p>So, he decided to undergo lap-band surgery in 2014 to lose the extra weight from his body. The surgery, combined with a balanced diet and exercise routine, helped him lose over 190 lbs and further maintain it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1trnLnpxmr5WetKnAjKWmrKtdqMKzs8SrsGegpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
