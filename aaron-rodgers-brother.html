Just, like, that kind of word, because it’s just not who I am, because, frankly, I was disappointed at every step of my life. No matter what I did, it was never good enough for a coach or a teammate because I was being compared to someone who did it best.”<br>-Jordan Rodgers</p><h3>Aaron Rodgers’ Date And Family</h3><p>Most even think that the family feud commenced as<a href=# rel=noopener> Aaron Rodgers</a> started dating. As per the sources, when Aarron dated Olivia Munn back in 2014, it drove numerous comments from his family.&nbsp;</p><p>As he dated Olivia, his parents weren’t happy with his relationship, and eventually, he chose Olivia and refused to talk about his family feud.</p><p>Indeed, he was disappointed as his girlfriend was dragged as the source of his family feud.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the news reported that Aaron had stopped talking to his family back in December 2014.</p><p>Thus, he refused to visit his grandfather’s funeral and even returned the Christmas gifts.

However, it was hard for Aaron to dodge the issue and not speak about it.&nbsp;</p><p>“As far as those kinds of things go, I’ve always found that it’s a little inappropriate to talk publicly about some family matters, so I’m just — I’m not going to speak on those things, but I wish him well in the competition.”<br>-Aaron Rodgers</p><h3>Olivia Munn’s Take</h3><p>Before Aaron and Olivia split, <a href=# rel=noopener>Edward Wesley Rodgers</a> had commented on his family feud. He stated that the things out in public felt better and hoped the item would get good.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, he added, “Fame changes everything.” Well, it’s not sure whether it was targeted at Aaron.</p><p>After Olivia Munn split with <a href=# rel=noopener>Aaron Rodgers</a>, she stated that Aaron had had conflicts with his family eight months before their date.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t think either side of the road is clean, but I think it’s not OK when you try to stand on someone’s shoulders and then throw dirt in their face, which is what I think they did with him.”&nbsp;<br>-Olivia Munn</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>If you are interested in Aaron Rodgers’ love life and affairs, click the link to read the detail.&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p>After Olivia’s comment, Jordan further commented on why she would like to speak about her ex, which didn’t go well.

However, not long after, his brothers tweeted about his tweet indirectly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>“But when your Mom is home alone during the fires, car packed, ready to evacuate, & you miss the fundamental first step of compassion, calling your parents to make sure they are safe… Everything else just feels like an act.” – Jordon Rodgers.</p><p>“Smells like cowardice this morning.” -Luke Rodgers.</p><h3>The On And Off Family Tension</h3><p>When <a href=# rel=noopener>Aaron Rodgers</a> started dating <a href=# rel=noopener>Danica Patrick</a>, he talked and became involved with the family more. Things got better every time, and they were more into each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, in December 2019, their relationship again became tense after Rodgers’ appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>Danica </a>Patrick’s&nbsp;Pretty Intense podcast.</p><p>During the podcast, Aaron talked about his religion and childhood upbringing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Aaron Rodgers</a> is engaged to <a href=# rel=noopener>Shailene Woodley</a> while their wedding planning is on hold.</p><p>But, talking about his family feud is still under challenging waters.
