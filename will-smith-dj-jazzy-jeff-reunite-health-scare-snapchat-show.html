I was like, ‘I feel like I’m coming down with something’ and got into bed, and I don’t remember the next 10 days,” <strong>DJ Jazzy Jeff </strong>says in the preview of the Apr. 15 episode of <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Will Smith</a></strong>‘s new Snapchat series, Will From Home. Jazz, 55, spoke to Will, 5,1 about his recent health scare, and how he suspected it might have been the novel coronavirus (COVID-19.). “I had a temperature that reached 103. I had the chills. I lost sense of smell. I lost sense of taste.” Since the loss of one’s sense of smell and taste are the two most recognizable symptoms of COVID-19, Jazz says he attempted to get tested, but couldn’t get one!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“They gave me a flu test,” he told Will. “And when I went and got the chest X-ray, she came in and said, ‘You have pneumonia in both your lungs.’ ” Double-pneumonia is scary enough (it’s why <strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> took time off from The View and why <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she stopped coming into work</a> before the show went under COVID lockdown) but in time of this pandemic? It’s enough to shake anyone’s confidence, which is what happened to Jazz’s wife, <strong>Lynette Jackson</strong>. “Yeah, that was scary because Lynette doesn’t panic, and she called me with the panic vibes.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“And so,” added Will, “I immediately called <strong>D-Nice </strong>to see if he would be available.” The joke immediately cracked up Jazz. “I was like, ‘not my DJ!’ ” shouted Will. Thankfully, as Jazz said, he “ain’t ready yet” to leave this world, but he added a bit of a reality check to this moment of hope. “Unfortunately, people think we’re at the end [of the pandemic.] I think we’re really at the beginning.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/will-smith-reconnects-dj-jazzy-jeff-rex-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I didn’t even realize the severity of it,” DJ Jazzy Jeff told host Tamron Hall over video chat on Tuesday (April 14), per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>. “When my wife and I were at the store, I looked at her and told her I didn’t feel well. And she was asking what was wrong, and I said ‘I feel a little achy, like I’m coming down with something.’ I literally went home and got into bed and almost don’t remember the next 11 days after that…” It would be around April 5 when Jazz would feel good enough to give a status update, telling all his Instagram followers that he wasn’t sick anymore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e5BuZrChnKF6tLnIrZ9mnJpit6LG2bJko52Wm3qzsdSnoK2dXZ2yorjToWSsm5Gnsm6%2FzZqnnKCRqXq0tM6wZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
