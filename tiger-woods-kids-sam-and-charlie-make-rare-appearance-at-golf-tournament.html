The PNC Championship, formerly known as the Father/Son Tournament, allows pro golfers to play alongside a family member. This is the first time Woods’ eldest daughter has appeared during the game.</p><p>“Sam was fantastic,” Wood told reporters at the game, per <a href=#>CBS Sports</a>. “This is the first time she’s ever done this, so it couldn’t have been any more special for all of us.”</p><p>He added, “For me to have both my kids inside the ropes like this and participating and playing and being part of the game of golf like this, it couldn’t have been more special for me, and I know that we do this a lot at home, needle each other and have a great time. But it was more special to do it in a tournament like this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tiger-Woods-PNC-Championship-with-son-Charlie-02.jpg><p>Though there is still one more day left in the tournament, Charlie and his father weren’t thrilled with their performance so far.</p><p>“I drove the ball really good today,” Charlie said. “Didn’t miss a fairway, and still managed to shoot 8-under. We just suck at putting.”</p><p>His dad concurred, “That sums it up right there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tiger-Woods-PNC-Championship-with-son-Charlie-01.jpg><p>Woods shares Sam and Charlie with <a href=#>ex-wife <strong>Elin Nordegren</strong></a>. The exes split in 2009 after six years of marriage amid the golfer’s <a href=#>affairs with multiple women</a>. He sought treatment for sex addiction amid the scandal.</p><p>Several years after the cheating scandal, Woods told <a href=#>TIME</a> in December 2015 that he and Nordegren were close pals and coparents. “Having the relationship that I have now with her is fantastic,” he said. “We’re able to pick up the phone, and we talk to each other all the time. … She talks to me about her life, I talk to her about my life. We try and help each other out on all occasions. And we work through it with the kids, the parenting program. She is one of my best friends now, and it’s all because of my kids.”</p><p>A source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in March that the pair were able to move past the pain of their split because they put the children first.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tiger-Woods-PNC-Championship-with-daughter-Sam-02.jpg><p>“Tiger and Elin are truly in a great place,” the insider told Us. “He’s been so great with the kids, and that really brought her around to having a friendship with Tiger.”</p><p>Nordegren has moved on with former football pro <strong>Jordan Cameron</strong>. They <a href=#>welcomed son Arthur</a> in October 2019.
