Here’s Hallmark’s official synopsis for the new movie:</p><p>“Romance novelist Emilia is a whirlwind who blows back into the lives of her adult children, Taylor and Zach, under the pretense of a book signing arranged by her hometown’s local bookshop. As Emilia tries to reconnect, Taylor and Zach explore new and past relationships through an app that boasts old-fashioned human connection by way of the classified ad. Zach is given a chance to heal old wounds while Taylor matches with Franki, a woman [who] changes the way she’s always thought about love.”</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>, actress <a href=#>Katherine McNamara</a> hyped up the journey her character, Taylor, takes in the movie: “Very much in the way that Schitt’s Creek did the whole ‘love the wine, not the label’ situation, which I love, this movie does something very similar. It just allows these characters to be surprised by love,” she said. “The fact that Taylor is willing to take the leap of faith and be open to what this connection could be turns out to be a huge gift.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fan-favorite TV stars take the lead in ‘Love, Classified.’</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p><a href=#>Melora Hardin</a>, who starred as Jacqueline Carlyle in The Bold Type but is perhaps best known for playing Jan Levinson on The Office, stars as Emilia in Love, Classified.</p><p>Her on-screen children, meanwhile, are played by the aforementioned Katherine McNamara, whom you might recognize as Shadowhunters’ Clary Fray or as Arrow’s Mia Smoak, and <a href=#>Max Lloyd-Jones</a>, who appeared as Tom Thornton on Hallmark’s When Calls the Heart.</p><p>And <a href=#>Arienne Mandi</a>, who broke out as Dani Nùñez on the Showtime drama The L Word: Generation Q, plays Franki in the new movie.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Like so many other Hallmark productions, the movie was filmed in British Columbia.</h2><p>The Canadian province of British Columbia has <a href=#>hosted so many Hallmark productions</a> that one IMDb user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">compiled a list of hundreds of them</a>, and Love, Classified is no exception.</p><p>Stacy N. Harding directed the movie — after previously helming Cut, Color, Murder for Hallmark Mystery & Movies and Christmas Sail for Hallmark — and she tagged the city of Victoria, British Columbia, as she celebrated the wrap pf filming on Love, Classified.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>“‘That’s a wrap!’” Stacy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in the February 18 post. “Honestly, such a wonderful experience making a movie that will turn some heads and warm many hearts.”</p><p>FYI, Victoria has also served as a filming location for the TV shows The X-Files and <a href=#>Maid</a> and the Deadpool and X-Men film series.
