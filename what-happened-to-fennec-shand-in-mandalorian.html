He and executive producer Dave Filoni have changed the trajectory of <a href=#>Star Wars</a> for the better with the introduction of several new, badass characters.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>Din Djarin</a>, aka Mando (<a href=#>Pedro Pascal</a>), is the most iconic of them all, but we can't forget about the elite mercenary and master assassin known as Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen).</p><p>She first arrives at the scene in Season 1 of The Mandalorian, in which she is pursued by the titular character and another bounty hunter, Toro Calican (Jake Cannavale). Does Fennec escape the pair? What happened to her? Keep reading to find out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Fennec Shand in 'The Mandalorian'?</h2><p>Season 1, Episode 5, titled "Chapter 5: The Gunslinger," continues to feature Mando on the run with Grogu. This time, Mando finds himself in Mos Eisley, where he encounters Toro Calican, a young bounty hunter aiming to join the Bounty Hunter's Guild by capturing Fennec Shand. Toro begs Mando for his help, and he eventually gives in.</p><p>As the two travel into the Dune Sea, they notice a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dewback</a> carrying a dead bounty hunter ... OK, then. It turns out the display is bait laid out by Fennec, and she quickly attacks the duo. Though Fennec puts up a good fight and destroys one of their speeder bikes, Mando and Toro successfully capture her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mando heads off for a bit, which leaves Toro with Fennec. She attempts to convince him to take Mando in over her, as his bounty would be worth more than hers. Plus, it will make Toro a legend. Sadly, her plan fails as Toro shoots her in the stomach, presumably bleeding to death from the wound.</p><p>So, did Star Wars really kill off a character after her brief introduction? Of course not! Thankfully, our lord and savior Boba Fett finds Fennec and saves her — with the help of a <a href=#>cyberpunk Mod Artist</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Fennec Shand a robot?</h2><p>In Episode 4 of <a href=#>The Book of Boba Fett</a>, viewers see the past via flashbacks, in which Boba recalls his first meeting with Fennec. As she bleeds out on the sands of Tattooine, Boba arrives and brings her to the outskirts of Mos Eisley for help. Thankfully, Boba encounters a mod parlor, and Fennec survives death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, there is a catch — Fennec is no longer fully human. To keep her alive, the Mod Artist replaces Fennec's damaged abdominal organs with cybernetic implants; when Boba asks the surgeon if he wants to close her up, he states that they shouldn't cover "all that beautiful machinery."</p><p>So, there you have it: Fennec is essentially a cyborg, like the biker gang that she and Boba hire as additional muscle. Hopefully, they all use their cybernetic advances to the best of their ability in the impending war against the Pyke Syndicate.</p><p>Catch new episodes of The Book of Boba Fett on Wednesdays, only on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSfnZ6jsqR50qGYp5xdnrtuucCnm5qkn6e2oro%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
