Her former costars <a href=#><strong>Monique Coleman</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lucas Grabeel</strong></a> were both in attendance at the destination wedding on December 2, which took place at the Azulik City of Arts.</p><p>‚ÄúCongrats @vanessahudgens & @cotuck üò≠üíç Your love is the stuff of fairytales‚Äù Coleman, 43, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Thursday, December 7, alongside a video of her and Hudgens jumping up and down together on the beach. The social media footage also showed Grabeel, 39, at the ceremony.</p><p>Before jetting off to <a href=#>celebrate Hudgens</a>, Coleman posted a photo that showed her at the Elle Women in Hollywood gala with former High School Musical costar <strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong>. Despite remaining close with Hudgens over the years, Tisdale, 38, was seemingly not at the wedding.</p><p>Hudgens rounded out her big day with her bridal party, which included sister <strong>Stella Hudgens</strong> and friends <strong>Sarah Hyland, Alexandra Shipp, Hailey Lavelle, Morgan Marcell </strong>and<strong> Laura New</strong>. Tucker, 27, was also joined by his loved ones, including fellow MLB stars <strong>Scott Kingery, Mitch Keller </strong>and<strong> Cody Bellinger</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Breaking-Down-Which-High-School-Musical-Stars-Scored-an-Invite-to-Vanessa-Hudgens-Wedding-1.png><p>The couple‚Äôs nuptials marked one of many <a href=#>High School Musical cast reunions</a> over the years. The Disney film franchise, which ran from 2006 to 2008, followed Troy (<strong>Zac Efron</strong>) and Gabriella (Vanessa), two teenagers from completely different cliques, who bond over their love of music. Their <a href=#>love story is the backdrop</a> for the film series as their friends take part in the school musical.</p><p>As most of the actors moved on from HSM, Tisdale continued to tell her character Sharpay‚Äôs story in a 2011 spinoff film titled Sharpay‚Äôs Fabulous Adventure. The movie also featured Vanessa‚Äôs now-ex-boyfriend <strong>Austin Butler</strong> in the role of the love interest. Butler, 32, has since <a href=#>remained friendly with Tisdale</a>, and they continued to spend time together after <a href=#>his 2020 split from Vanessa.</a></p><p>In 2019, Disney+ released the first season of <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a>, which was set at a fictionalized version of the real Utah high school where the HSM movies were filmed. The show ran for four seasons and launched careers for <strong>Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett, Sofia Wylie </strong>and<strong> Julia Lester</strong>.</p><p>Coleman and Grabeel were just some of the OG cast members who <a href=#>made appearances</a> on the show. Efron, Vanessa and Tisdale, however, opted out of the onscreen reunion.</p><p>Earlier this year, HSMTMTS creator, <strong>Tim Federle</strong>, confirmed he reached out to Efron, Vanessa and Tisdale but their <a href=#>potential cameos didn‚Äôt work out</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúAshley called me personally and was so lovely. She‚Äôs very busy launching brands and it just wasn‚Äôt the right timing,‚Äù Federle told Trib Total Media in August. ‚ÄúAnd I got the feeling with Zac and Vanessa, who I don‚Äôt know personally but I‚Äôm a fan, reading the tea leaves, that by the time you get into negotiating what this would take, we‚Äôre gonna wrap and the show will be over.‚Äù</p><p>During an exclusive chat with Us Weekly, Federle revealed that director <strong>Kenny Ortega</strong> was <a href=#>another OG he hoped to appear.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>‚ÄúIt was so great to get the originals back because it launched their careers in such explosive ways. [That is] the same way I think some of the cast members of my show are getting launched into the world,‚Äù Federle exclusively shared with Us in August. ‚ÄúI loved seeing how humble and grateful and just cool they are now ‚Äî as young adults ‚Äî Corbin and Monique and Lucas. I really wanted to get Kenny Ortega back.‚Äù</p><p>He added: ‚ÄúI called Kenny. He was super busy on a project. He could not have been more gracious. I said, ‚ÄòDo you want to come back and play Kenny?‚Äô And he was like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the coolest idea. I can‚Äôt.‚Äô He was editing a documentary. Kenny‚Äôs on my bucket list. [I‚Äôve] got to collaborate with Kenny someday. But I‚Äôm really satisfied with how we wrapped up the whole show.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2appWowKJ5x66boJ2eqHqqutWiq56cXZ22qLSMrJqhp5%2Bheq7B0qKamqRdmLy0wMCrqmasn2K1pr6MsJydnJmjtHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
