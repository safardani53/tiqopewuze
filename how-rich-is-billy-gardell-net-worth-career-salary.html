The comedian is 53 years old and has an $8 million net worth as of April 2023. Gardell began his career in comedy as a dare while working at a tiny Pittsburgh bar. Jackie Gleason impacted the actor’s comic approach. He characterized himself as a “chubby youngster” who felt he’d be humorous on TV, similar to how he got his inspiration from The Honeymooners. Gardell was also influenced by Richard Pryor, George Carlin, John Candy, and John Belushi’s comedy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Billy-Gardell-2.jpg alt="Billy Gardell" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2013, he made his stand-up comedy debut with Billy Gardell Presents Road Dogs, and in 2014, he launched the lottery game program Monopoly Millionaires’ Club.</p><h2>More information about Gardell’s personal life</h2><p>The actor was recently in the news for his weight reduction struggle after gastric bypass surgery. His general health, including his blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes, improved as a result of the operation. Gardell said that he was happy than he had been in many years, but cautioned others not to follow in his footsteps and get the procedure. The comedian went on to say:</p><p>“It’s a really personal choice.” It seemed right to me. That is something I want to be clear about.”</p><p>Gardell said that his choice to get the operation had no effect on his connection with the creators of Bob Hearts Abishola, the program in which he presently appears.</p><p>Chuck Lorre, the show’s director, stated:</p><p>“We’ll simply admit that you’re taking better care of yourself on the show because that’s the reality.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Billy-Gardell-1.jpg alt="Billy Gardell" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actor, who will appear in Guy’s Ultimate Game Night, has been married to Patty Knight since 2001, and the couple has a kid.
