Learn all about him, and Emmy’s ex husband, below.</p><h2>Sam Is A Hollywood Power Player</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>The New Jersey native, born Sept. 17, 1977, has made quite the name for himself in Tinseltown. He’s known for serving as the creator, lead writer and director of the series Mr. Robot, starring&nbsp;<strong>Rami Malek</strong>. He directed the psychological thriller series Homecoming starring <strong>Julia Roberts</strong> and the Peacock series Angelyne, starring his own wife Emmy. He also is developing a Battlestar Galactica reboot. To catch an update on any one of his projects, be sure to check out Sam’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, where he loves to post about his Hollywood endeavors.</p><h2>Where Was Their Meet-Cute?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The adorable couple met in 2013, when Emmy landed a role in the film Comet, directed and written by Sam. The romantic dramedy costarred <strong>Justin Long</strong>. Soon after meeting on the set, they started secretly dating and made their debut <span>as a couple at the June 2014 premiere of </span>Comet.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sam’s New York Times Proposal Was Epic</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In August 2015, Sam got down on one knee in one of the greatest proposals ever, as he recreated a section of The New York Times with the big question in it for Emmy to discover.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“We have a tradition of reading the ‘Modern Love’ section of&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;every Sunday,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emmy&nbsp; told Vogue&nbsp;in 2017</a>. “I do a dramatic reading of it for him. Even if we’re not in the same place, I read it to him over the phone. Then one weekend we didn’t read it — I don’t remember why exactly — and the following Friday he reminded me that we hadn’t.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>She went on to explain how Sam had written their own love story down and a friend helped make it look like it was authentically a New York Times piece. “I kind of scanned to the end and it said, ‘Love, your Sam.’ And I realized that he had gone through this whole process of writing this whole story,” Emmy said. “And then by the time I finished the story he was down on a knee in the bathroom, with me in the tub.”</p><h2>They Held Their Wedding Reception At The Guggenheim</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>The couple wed in May 2017 at the Central Synagogue on Lexington Avenue in New York City. Afterwards, they partied the night away at the famed Guggenheim art museum. Emmy rocked a <strong>Carolina Herrera</strong> wedding dress that was inspired by the art museum’s iconic architecture, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>.</p><h2>Sam Didn’t Recognize Emmy As Angelyne</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Years after meeting on the set of the 2013 film&nbsp;Comet, the couple would go on to work together for the 2022 Peacock series&nbsp;Angelyne, in Sam was executive producer and Emmy took on the titular role as the LA Billboard icon. She must have really gone method acting, as Sam recalled not being able to recognize when she was all dolled up as the real-life character.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“When I say that there are times where I did not recognize her because she was lost in this person, I really mean it,” Sam told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a> of his wife’s “kind of eerie” transformation. “This is my wife I’m talking about.”</p><h2>Who Was Emmy’s First Husband?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Emmy-Rossum-Husband-Sam-Esmail-splsh-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Emmy was previously married to music&nbsp;producer&nbsp;<strong>Justin Siegel. </strong>The pair privately tied the knot in 2008, and kept their marriage a secret until Justin filed for divorce in 2010. “Everyone messes up in relationships and has peaks and valleys in their personal lives,” Emmy told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>InStyle Hair</a> in 2012 of the split. “When I realized it wasn’t the end of the world and I would keep on standing, I knew it was going to be OK.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8SmpLJloqTAtMHMZp%2Buq5KWu6V5lGpobW1kanw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
