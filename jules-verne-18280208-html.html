His collaboration with publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of extra-story tours, a series of successful adventure novels including Journey to the Center of Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Around the World in Eighty Days. Verne is considered an important author in France and most of Europe, where he had a great influence on pioneer literature and surrealism. His reputation was noticeably different in the English-speaking regions, where he was often considered a writer of novels or children's books, largely due to the reduced and edited translations for which his novels are often printed. Since the 1980s, his literary reputation has continued to improve. Verne is the second most translated author in the world since 1979, standing between Agatha Christie and William Shakespeare.</p><table class=wikibox readability=17><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Jules Gabriel Verne, February 08, 1828, Nantes, France</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>March 24, 1905, Amiens, France</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>La Madeleine cemetery, Amiens, France</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Novelist, poet, playwright</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Period</td><td class=wk_value>1850–1905</td></tr><tr readability=10><td class=wk_label>Notable works</td><td class=wk_value>Around the World in Eighty Days, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, The Mysterious Island, From the Earth to the Moon These five, and most of Verne's novels, were published in the Voyages extraordinaires series.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>1 son: Michel Verne, 2 step-daughters, Valentine Morel, Suzanne Morel</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/jules-verne-hllq-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Novelist Jules Verne was born on February 8, 1828 in Nantes, France (He dies at the age of 77, on March 24, 1905).</p><p>This creative French novelist's two famous science fiction and adventure novels are 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Journey to the Center of the Earth.
