During the episode, Khloe was still dealing with the aftermath of her split from ex, <strong>Tristan Thompson</strong>, who is also the father of her daughter, <strong>True Thompson</strong>. Fans of the show will know that the two ended their relationship after Tristan’s cheating scandal with former Kardashian family friend, <strong>Jordyn Woods</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I still have not spoken to Tristan face-to-face. And, right now, I’m not ready to,” Khloe admitted at the start of the episode, which featured True’s birthday party where she saw Tristan for the first time since the scandal. “I know I’ll get to that place. Right now, it’s really challenging and tough for me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Later on in the episode, Khloe also revealed that Tristan tried to kiss her when she pulled him over for an off-camera conversation. After he asked her to have&nbsp;“a glass of wine,” Khloe described the awkward encounter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“And then he was like, ‘Can I have a hug?’ And then I one-arm hugged him and he was like, ‘One? A one-handed hug?'” Khloe explained to her glam team. “I was like, ‘That’s nice enough.’ And then he tried to kiss me and I go, ‘This is the problem with you. You can’t just take what you get.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH16e5BqZqSgnKSybrfAq5uaq5ierq95waWYnKNdobKiwMeeqWanpamzqsCMqZ%2BorJ%2Boeq6ty6KimmWYlr6yecuupZygXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
