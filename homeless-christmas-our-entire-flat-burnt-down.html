We don't have time to plan anything grand and don't have the kitchen appliances to make it happen. We lost everything in the fire.</p><p>"We're living off simple curries and takeout pizza. There's no other option for a quick meal. My wife is too traumatised to cook.</p><p>"On Christmas Day we'll either make something easy or order out. We want to focus on our family and spending time together."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The family is now sleeping on a mattress on the floor of an unfurnished temporary flat in their old building.</p><p>He said: "We had two sofas belonging to earlier tenants. I bought a mattress and put it on the floor because I don't want wooden furniture that's heavy."</p><p>Now Mr Singh has to find another home for his family, but says it's been impossible so close to Christmas.</p><p>"Everywhere is so expensive. Christmas is a hard time to be homeless, there's nowhere to go," he said.</p><p>Footage filmed by a passerby during the December 19 fire showed flames erupting out of one of the third-floor flat's windows.</p><p>Mr Singh added: "The kids are in shock and my wife now trembles when she cooks. I'm trying to stay strong.</p><p>"We were bare foot and in pyjamas when we ran from the fire."</p><p>Mr Singh, an IT consultant who moved to the UK from <a href=#>India</a> in February, was getting ready to take a shower when he smelled burning.</p><p>He added: "I pushed the door to my office come storage room and it was hard to open. After using more force it opened and I saw the flames inside. Everything we own was stored in there.</p><p>"We lost all our winter clothes, office clothes, everything. A couple of laptops, a camera, harddrives, chargers, all gone."</p><p>Mr Singh told how he couldn't find a fire extinguisher and the alarms in the other flats didn't go off.</p><p>Eventually a fire brigade was called and the crew battled the flames as they took over the entire flat.</p><p>Neighbours fled their homes and congregated outside for hours, some questioning the family.</p><p>Mr Singh added: "Some were lovely and comforting, others asked probing questions and it scared my wife.</p><p>"We hadn't eaten in hours and were all starving but the babies were refusing food."</p><p>Now the family will be spending Christmas, and their daughters' second birthdays, in an unfurnished temporary apartment, rebuilding their lives.</p><p>One neighbour has set up a <a aria-label="GoFundMe (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe</a> to help.</p><p>Dawid Skorkiewicz told The Sun: "They've lost thousands of pounds worth of belongings. We watched the flames through the flat's window. It was terrifying."</p><p>A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: “Fires can cause devastation all year round, but this is heightened around Christmas with families potentially left homeless and possessions destroyed. We want to ensure Londoners take every precaution to prevent fires from spoiling the festive period.&nbsp;</p><p>“Keep candles well away from any Christmas decorations. Decorations can easily fuel a fire and as Christmas trees dry out, they can burn quickly and cause flames to spread in seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>“Consider using battery-powered, flameless LED candles instead, which are safe even if you fall asleep. Whilst they may cost more upfront than traditional candles, they will last considerably longer, giving you better value for money.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“If you do choose to use traditional candles ensure you place them in a heat-resistant holder, on a stable surface where they won’t be knocked over and away from materials that could catch fire. Never leave them unattended around your home, take particular care with children and pets and blow them out properly before you go to bed.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whether you’re spending Christmas at home, or away with friends or family, take some time to carry out a few simple checks to keep yourself and your loved ones safe."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/family-left-homeless-days-christmas-867678704.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/64962df3-9c54-4914-8590-741aa9a83bed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/family-left-homeless-days-christmas-867678693.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JyfpNrb2pnmKS6prjErKpmm5intrTAzJqqZqelp3qmutOiqZ5llqGutXnBrqmnrF2ZvLi6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
