He made his <a href=#>professional debut</a> with the Washington Nationals in 2012. Varner, a soccer player, attended Brigham Young University before transferring to The Ohio State University.</p><p>As the duo navigated long-distance romance, Harper popped the question in 2014. They were set to wed in January 2015 but called off the nuptials.</p><p>Less than one year later, the couple got back together, with Varner confirming in July 2016 that the <a href=#>engagement</a> was back on. She and Harper exchanged vows that December.</p><p>“He’s this big, professional baseball player and you would never know it off the field because he treats everyone with respect and is genuine,” Varner told The Knot after their wedding. “He’s selfless, the most selfless guy ever… I think that’s what always attracted me to him. And he’s goofy and funny—he loves to play pranks on me, and as much as I get annoyed by it, I secretly love it—he’s just the best. I love him.”</p><p>Harper added, “I was very excited and overwhelmed with emotion — just the whole process and getting everything done and finally seeing my bride and wife. You know, you dream about things like that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>More than two years later, the pair announced Varner was <a href=#>pregnant</a>. She gave birth to son Krew in August 2019, and daughter Brooklyn was born in November 2020.</p><p>Scroll through to see their timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7PFwp5koZmipbKzedainZ5lm5bGra2Mr5irppWnwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
