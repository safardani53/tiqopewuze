We’re so excited and we just love working together. It’s just a dream come true. We have known each other for a long time, but to be able to collaborate in a big way and really be architects behind the scenes is really nice.”</p><p>At the time, the <a href=#>Legally Blonde</a> actress thought it might be a while before the cast reunited for season 3.</p><p>“[Jennifer]’s<a href=#> finishing a movie</a> with <a href=#><strong>Adam Sandler</strong></a> so it’s gonna be a minute and then we are gonna get right on it. … Give the people what they want,” she said. Witherspoon and Aniston play Bradley Jackson and Alex Levy, respectively, the news anchors at the center of the popular drama.</p><p></p><p>Aniston, for her part, told The Hollywood Reporter in November 2021 that she wasn’t sure about playing Alex again. In season 2, her character struggled with returning to the public eye while mourning Mitch (played by <a href=#><strong>Steve Carell</strong></a>) and contracting COVID-19.</p><p>“It’s so hard to even imagine it right now,” the <a href=#>Friends</a> alum told the outlet at the time.&nbsp;<i> </i>“You know when they say mothers almost have a block [after giving birth]: ‘I could never do that again!’ I’m a little bit in that moment of, ‘I don’t know if I could ever do that again!’ So, we’ll see.”</p><p>The Emmy winner also expressed her hopes that the tone of her story shifts in subsequent seasons, saying she’d like to see “a lot more levity” in the next installment.</p><p>Showrunner <strong>Kerry Ehrin</strong>, for her part, told The Hollywood Reporter that the possibilities for&nbsp;The Morning Show are really endless.</p><p>“You could [go 10 years forward]. You could go backwards. It’s such an interesting little universe,” she said in November 2021. “You really can put it anywhere in time, and I think the challenge of the show is coming up with that big subject. Because, those are real subjects. They’re not fabricated. They’re pulled from all of our lives and they greatly impacted all of us, and I think that’s always the <a href=#>challenge of the show</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Season 3 of The Morning Show is set to debut in the fall.
