I predict people overdrinking and being overserved in Vegas,” Pellegrino, 38, exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>on Tuesday, October 24, while promoting his new book, <i><a href=# rel=noopener>The Jolliest Bunch: Unhinged Holiday Stories</a>. </i>“And I had a dream that I’m sitting at a blackjack table with <a href=#><strong>Karen Huger</strong> </a>[and] just gambling.”</p><p class=p1>Pellegrino further told <i>Us </i>that the annual convention — which is<a href=#> heading to Sin City for the first time</a> — is sure to be “nuts.”</p><p class=p1>“I’m really <a href=#>excited about the announcements</a>,” he said. “Usually there’s always either new shows or new trailers for seasons. So that’s what I’m most excited about.”</p><p class=p1>While Pellegrino is eagerly awaiting what reveals will be in store <a href=#>during the three-day con</a>, he is also hoping that the panels will provide answers to some of the shows’ biggest questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Danny-Pellegrino-Predicts-Chaos-at-BravoCon.jpg><p class=p1>“Well, I’m wondering,<a href=#><i> [The Real Housewives of] Orange County</i></a> just wrapped their season and <a href=#><strong>Shannon Beador</strong> </a>had this stuff that was going on. So I’m curious if that’ll be addressed at all,” he speculated, referring to Beador’s <a href=#>recent arrest for a DUI and a hit-and-run incident</a>.</p><p class=p1>BravoCon kicks off on Friday, November 3 at Caesars Forum, running through Sunday, November 5. Faithful fans, like Pellegrino, can attend panels for<a href=#> their favorite Bravo franchises</a> including the <i>Real Housewives, <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>, <a href=#>Summer House </a></i>and <a href=#><i>Southern Charm</i></a>. More than 150 Bravo stars are expected to attend to rehash their onscreen drama and tease what’s coming next.</p><p class=p1>Pellegrino, for his part, is a big fan of the network’s dramatic moments, like <a href=#><i>Pump Rules</i>’ Scandoval</a> or<a href=#> <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </i></a>season 13 diving into <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>’ marital woes.</p><p class=p1>“I like the drama, but then when it gets too heavy, then I’m like, ‘OK, let’s dig a way of this,’” Pellegrino explained on Tuesday. “I like when they fight about chair placements and who’s sitting where. Or you know what <a href=#>[<i>Real Housewives of ] Salt Lake City </i></a>does well [is] where it’s such a dichotomy of the <a href=#>really heavy stuff of <strong>Jen Shah</strong></a> [and her legal drama], but then you also have the petty stuff. I like that kind of mix.”</p><p class=p1>In addition to keeping tabs on the Bravolebrities, Pellegrino recently released <a href=#>a book of holiday essays</a>, titled <i>The Jolliest Bunch: Unhinged Holiday Stories,</i> which hit store shelves on Tuesday.</p><p class=p1>“I had a book come out last year called <i>How Do I Un-Remember This?</i> and as I was putting that collection of stories together, I found that there were a lot of holiday stories that were chaotic and what I thought were really funny,” Pellegrino told <i>Us</i>. “And so, my dream was to put together this book. … I wanted to feel like the movie <i>Christmas Vacation </i>or<i> A Christmas Story</i>. I wanted to kind of have those vibes of those movies that I watch yearly with my family or friends.”</p><p class=p1>Stories in <i>The Jolliest Bunch </i>range from laugh-out-loud funny to heartwarming as Pellegrino relives his favorite festive memories with his loved ones.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I hope with all of the stories about my family, people realize it’s coming from so much love,” he added. “I’m so proud to be from Midwest and I’m so proud to be from my family and to get to share these stories that I sort of always thought were funny. Everyone has kind of their cocktail stories where when the family’s together, they’re retelling that crazy <a href=#>Christmas Eve</a> or the birthday party or whatever. And so, I wanted this to be my cocktail stories.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6jxm68xKWjnp%2Binruwec%2BrnJ2hk6nAbrzUq5xmm5iWvLR5wK1km6qRq7yku81maWlqY2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
