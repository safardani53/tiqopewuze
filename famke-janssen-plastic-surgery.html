Some even said that if she had done a face surgery, it wasn’t a good option for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/famke-janssen-plastic-surgery.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">A collage picture of Famke Janssen before (right) and after (left) her alleged face surgery (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Fans have been in a rage since the last episode of The Capture premiered in 2019. Many took to their social media handles to share a supposed before and after picture of the actress and simultaneously expressed their disappointment.</p><p>One of the actress’ fans even tweeted, “Watched finale of #The Capture. No spoilers. The music in the finale sounded like an episode of Westworld. Also, took me while to realize that was Famke Janssen #plasticsurgery.”</p><p>Another fan tweeted, “Oh my god Famke Janssen’s plastic surgery is awful.” The surging tweet never stopped showing disagreement with Janssen’s big step.</p><p>Although the love for her didn’t diminish with the disagreement, as another critiqued, “My biggest regret of this decade was not telling Famke Janssen I was in love with her before she ruined her face with that plastic surgery.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/famkecapture2-edited.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><span class="has-inline-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-color">Famke Janssen after her alleged plastic surgery. (Photo: Giant Freakin Robot)</span></p><p>The most amusing art that her face [after alleged plastic surgery] portrayed was her natural laughter lines replaced by a line-free, pillowy complexion.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">Famke Janssen’s plastic surgery: Is it just a speculation or fact?</h2><p>As of this writing, it’s unclear whether Janssen ever had face surgery. Multiple media outlets have articulated that it might be a misconception that the viewers are not able to recognize her due to the effect of filters or the magic of makeup.&nbsp;</p><p>The look was shocking for the viewers as the <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/actor/tom-lewis/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Redeeming Love</a> star has always been admired for her looks when she was still modeling and even when she appeared on the big screen. People said she used fillers, botox, and so on to reignite her beauty.</p><p>DailyMail reported that her natural laughter lines were gone and were replaced by a line-free, pillowy complexion. The outlet also mentioned that her wrinkle-free face appeared to be frozen in time. On the other hand, many media cruelly dubbed her ‘The Superhero of Botox.’</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Jenssen’s silence on all of this has made the topic of her getting plastic surgery ambiguous, as she has not defended herself in all the conversations and issues that have arisen regarding her speculated plastic surgery.</p><p>Janssen’s role in the field of acting and directory has been remarkable and preferred by the viewers.&nbsp;Although the talk of her getting plastic surgery surged in 2019, the heat has cooled down in today’s date, making the life of the actress easier and more peaceful.</p><p>She received much love for her awaited series Redeeming Love, which premiered on January 22, 2022. Her acting projects afterward, including Long Slow Exhale and Boy Kills World, have also been well received by the viewers.</p><p>That said, the actress is currently unavailable on any of the social media platforms, making her even more secretive. But it has never been a problem for Janssen to stand in the Hall of Fame of cinema.</p><p>And disregarding the matter of age, Janssen’s fan followers are enough to keep her in rage for the upcoming decades.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A brief look at Famke Janssen’s bio</h2><p>Born in 1965, Famke celebrates her birthday every year on November 5, making her 59 years of age in December 2023. She was <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://byliner.com/did-famke-janssen-get-plastic-surgery-and-where-is-she-now/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raised</a> in the suburbs of Amstelveen, the Netherlands, in a family of creative talents.</p><p>As of this writing, there are little to no details known about her parents, except that they are divorced, and their surnames are Beumer and Janssen, respectively. Apart from her parents, she has two siblings: sisters named Antoinette Beumer and Marjolein Beumer.</p><p>Both of her sisters have had a fruitful career in the entertainment industry — Antoinette is a director, and Marjolein is an actress. Likewise, her siblings adopted the surname Beumer following their parents’ divorce.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Coming over to Famke’s education, she completed high school and then enrolled at the University of Amsterdam to pursue a degree in economics; however, she ended up regretting this decision.</p><p>She later redirected her academic focus to study creative writing and literature, which she did at Columbia University’s School of General Studies. Besides that, she is multilingual and is proficient in Dutch, English, and French. She no longer maintains her German language skills.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Famke Janssen’s dating life explored</h2><p>Famke is one of those Hollywood stars who prefer to keep their personal life hidden away from the media and public. She doesn’t use social media, steers away from the media, and rarely makes a public appearance.</p><p>The actress once <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://news.amomama.com/301320-does-famke-janssen-have-a-husband-the-ac.html rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opened up</a> about keeping her dating life private and stated, “I basically shun the press. I’m sure you googled me to try and find some things, but I am super private and realized a long time ago that I don’t really like people knowing anything about me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As she continued, she mentioned that her choice of life came with cons, one of which was she made less than other actors. “I decided I’d rather be less famous and do things on my terms,” she concluded her statement.</p><p>But despite her willingness to keep things secret, little things come out, and people want to learn more about her, especially her personal life. So, does the actress have a husband? Is she married? Or is she dating a boyfriend?</p><p>As of this writing, Famke isn’t married to a husband. However, it has been reported that she is still in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend, Cole Frates. The couple reportedly began dating in the late 2000s or early 2010s and have been together since then.</p><p>However, as they keep things low-key, people often wonder if they are still together. For instance, when they began dating, they made a few public appearances and were spotted on their outings here and there.</p><p>But it was awfully quiet after some time, leading many to wonder if they had broken up. But on one beautiful day in April 2017, the couple was <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4401814/Famke-Janssen-enjoys-bike-ride-boyfriend-dog.html rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spotted</a> together, going on a short bike ride with Famke’s beloved pooch Licorice alongside them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Famke-Janssen-boyfriend-Cole-Frates-pooch-Licorice.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Famke Janssen with her boyfriend, Cole Frates, and pooch Licorice (Photo: DailyMail)</p><p>This reassured the fans that they were still together. However, as these public appearances aren’t frequent, people often reignite the breakup rumors. But nothing can be said until an official confirmation comes. Who knows, they might still be together!</p><p>Before Famke began dating Frates, she was married to her now-former husband, Kip Williams. The actress and the director – son of architect Tod Williams – married in 1995, and their marital relationship ended in a divorce in 2000.</p><p>After that, it’s reported that she dated Josh Peck in 2007 and York Alec Shackleton. Furthermore, it has been rumored that she dated Ryan Gosling in 2004, but these rumors have neither been confirmed nor denied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrq52jqHynrcyknGaikaPAtLHNZqelmaOptqR50q6poJ2irnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
