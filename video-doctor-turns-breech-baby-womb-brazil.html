I thought it was fantastic.</p><p>“The mother felt very calm. The doctor is very capable and blessed.</p><p>“Congratulations to the team.”</p><p>Another, Sandra said: “Few doctors know how to do this technique correctly. In most public hospitals, women suffer too much.”</p><p>Viviany wrote: “Wow, if all hospitals had more doctors like this, women wouldn't suffer so much.</p><p>“May God continue to bless this doctor. And may more doctors come like this.”</p><p>Luis remarked: “Guys, how beautiful!
