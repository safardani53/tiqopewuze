Emily thinks that he could be the one.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>We told you back in May that Emily broke up with Bachelor <strong>Brad Womack</strong> because of David — and it turns out her feelings are stronger than ever. Emily went to David’s sister <strong>Anna Lisa</strong>‘s wedding on July 30 at Quail Hollow Country Club in Charlotte, and we’ve obtained pics of Emily posing with David’s mom, <strong>Bonnie Smith</strong>. Our source tells us that Emily has gotten very close with Bonnie, posting things on her Facebook wall like: “looking forward to our walk, hope you had a great weekend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“David is a sweetheart,” our source says. “The entire Smith family has been through a lot. David’s sister Anna Lisa was in a horrible drunk driving accident a couple of years back and she almost lost her life, she was never supposed to walk again — it’s a miracle she’s okay. David comes from a very generous and great family, they love Emily.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Our source goes on to say that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emily and David </a>began dating before she ever went on the Bachelor and that it was one big joke when Brad picked her at the end.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Emily was head over heels for David before she left to tape the show,” our source says. “Everyone had a big laugh when the world thought she was in love with Brad because we all knew she’d be coming back for David. David knew too, no one was worried, her relationship with Brad was totally fake.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Do you think this will hurt Emily’s chances of becoming the next Bachelorette?</p><h3>— Chloe Melas</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8><br><strong>Get MORE Entertainment News HERE!</strong></p><li>Kendall & Kylie Jenner Tweet Pics From Their Outdoor Photo Shoot!
