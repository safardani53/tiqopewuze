He has recorded over a hundred complete operas and is known for his versatility, performing regularly in Italian, French, German, Spanish, English and Russian in the world's most prestigious operas. Although primarily a lirico-spinto soprano for most of his career, most famous for Cavaradossi, Hoffmann, Don José and Canio, he quickly moved on to more dramatic roles, becoming Otello, the most beloved of his generation. In the early 2010s, he moved from a southern repertoire to almost exclusively a southern accent, notably Simon Boccanegra. In 2020, Domingo played 151 different roles. Domingo has also enjoyed considerable success as a cross-artist, especially in Latin genres and pop music. In addition to winning 14 Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, some of his records have won silver, gold, platinum and poly-platinum awards.</p><table class=wikibox readability=8><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>José Plácido Domingo Embil, January 21, 1941, Madrid, Spain</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Alma mater</td><td class=wk_value>National Conservatory of Music, Mexico</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Opera singer, conductor, arts administrator</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1957–present</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>3, including Plácido Jr.</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/placido-domingo-gyxl-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Opera Singer Plácido Domingo was born in Spain on January 21, 1941.
