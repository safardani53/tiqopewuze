seen holding hands with his eldest child <a href=#>North</a>.</p><p>The architect wore an <a href=#>oversized</a> black leather trench coat and matching heeled boots.</p><p>She had her platinum blonde <a href=#>hair</a> cut close to her head with longer pieces gelled down the front, and she flaunted full glam <a href=#>makeup</a> for her hubby's special day.</p><p>North showed off her own eclectic style in a long-sleeved gray T-shirt, black biker shorts, and chunky boots.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Kanye West">Read more on Kanye West</h2><p>The little girl wore her hair tied back as she walked and chatted with her new stepmom.</p><p>The preteen seemed to have taken a spill prior to the event, as the right side of her face was covered with a large scrape, scabbed over with dried blood.</p><p><a href=#>Bianca</a> grabbed North's hand as they crossed the street and made their way to <a href=#>Kanye's party</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Kanye</a> celebrated his birthday in a low-key fashion, with â€œcandlelight, music, and epic food," a source revealed to The U.S. Sun.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The guest list was small, with just the <a href=#>Yeezy</a> founder, Bianca, and some art folk in attendance.</p><p>According to the insider, North stole the show as she was running around with a camcorder to capture the moment.</p><h2><strong>KAR-JENNER SNUB</strong></h2><p>Kanye was born on June 8, 1977,&nbsp;making him officially 46 years old as of Thursday.</p><p>None of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Kardashian</a>-Jenner family shared a birthday post on <a href=#>social media</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim</a>'s ex-husband and baby daddy.</p><p>Kim and Kanye&nbsp;<a href=#>share four children together</a>:&nbsp;<a href=#>North</a>, <a href=#>Saint</a>, seven;&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago</a>, five, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Psalm</a>, four.</p><p>Throughout the day, the entire family was silent, despite wishing other exes in the past a happy birthday.</p><p>Just recently,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney</a>'s ex and baby daddy&nbsp;<a href=#>Scott Disick</a>, 40, celebrated a birthday and&nbsp;<a href=#>most of the Kardashian clan</a>&nbsp;reached out.</p><p>Kim shared a&nbsp;<a href=#>heartfelt message</a>&nbsp;on her&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;Story where she said he's a great dad.</p><p><a href=#>Khloe</a>, 38, shared a post where she took a walk down memory lane.</p><p>Kim's mom, <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a>, 67, was one of the first people to acknowledge his birthday on <a href=#>social media</a>, and she reminded him that she loves him.</p><p>However, Kourtney, 44, didn't wish him a happy birthday publicly.</p><h2>TUMULTUOUS END</h2><p><a href=#>Kim and Kanye filed for divorce</a> in February 2021, finalizing the paperwork a year and a half later.</p><p>By the end of 2022, the <a href=#>rapper slammed his ex-wife</a>, threatened to&nbsp;gain control of their four kids,&nbsp;and verbally&nbsp;<a href=#>attacked her ex Pete Davidson</a>&nbsp;in various social media posts.</p><h2><strong>MOVING ON</strong></h2><p>In early 2023, <a href=#>Kanye got married to Bianca,</a> who fans think <a href=#>looks eerily similar to Kim</a>.</p><p>The Donda rapper&nbsp;<a href=#>secretly tied the knot</a>&nbsp;with Bianca, as the pair were spotted wearing their&nbsp;<a href=#>lavish wedding bands</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Bianca, who is from Melbourne,&nbsp;<a href=#>Australia</a>, is said to be a jewelry and architectural designer who has been working at Yeezy since November 2020.</p><p>It is unknown how long the newlyweds have been together, though it presumably has only been a matter of months or even weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
