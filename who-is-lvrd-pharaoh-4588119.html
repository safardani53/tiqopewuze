After getting <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>matching face tattoos</a> of each others’ names on Nov. 22, fans were wondering who is Summer’s latest love and how the lovebirds got so serious so fast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>So who exactly is the new man who was able to capture <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the “Body” singer’s</a> heart after her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rollercoaster relationship</a> with <strong>London on da Track</strong>? We’ve got what you need to know about Lvrd below!</p><h2><strong>He’s a rapper&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Although not much can be found about Summer’s boo just yet, he’s in the same lane as the “Playing Games” songstress, currently building a rap career. His most recent album,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The King N’ The Prophet</a>, was just released for streaming. The collaboration was released in collaboration with fellow rapper PJTheKing.</p><h2><span><span><i>He & Summer knew each other for years before dating</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Lvrd may be a new face to Summer fans, but not to Summer, as the pair have reportedly known each other for quite some time. Although they’ve known each other for a few years, they only just started seriously dating within the past few months.&nbsp;“So grateful to have this man. he just increases my over all quality of life,” Summer said in a since-deleted Instagram post, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HotNewHipHop</a>. “I’ve never had someone put me & my child first before everything. To not have to lift a finger, for someone to truly be emotionally & spiritually intelligent & invested in me. It’s new & it’s nice.”</p><h2><span><span><i>He also works as a stylist&nbsp;</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>In addition to his music career, Lvrd revealed in a Feb. 2020 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Studio 306</a> that he also works as a stylist. His eccentric, unique styles have garnered him collaborations with big name rappers like&nbsp;<strong>2 Chainz</strong>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Usher</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>T.I.</strong></a>, and more. “Who haven’t I worked with?” the young fashion connoisseur exclaimed in the video, hinting at other major collaborations. Judging from his illustrious Instagram feed, his style is definitely cutting edge!</p><h2><span><span><i>He used to dance with Usher&nbsp;</i></span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>While speaking with Studio 306, Lvrd revealed that in addition to being a rapper and stylist, he also used to be a dancer. “I danced with Usher back in 2014,” he shared. I did the [BET Awards] and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Voice</a>&nbsp;and I did [the] ‘<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Good Kisser</a>‘ video and that translated into me styling because he liked the way I dressed.” Although the performer appreciated the work he got as a dancer, he ultimately ended up giving up the profession to focus on making music himself. “I used to be a dancer [but] I had to retire,” he shared in the interview. “My bones started getting achey!”</p><h2><strong>He & Summer are looking to start a family&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Summer may have just had her first <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby girl</a> in March, but she’s apparently ready to take things to the next level with Lvrd, posting a photo of the two cozying up together in a now-deleted Instagram post, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hip-hopvibe.com</a>. “Can’t wait to have a real family & a [sic] actual happy pregnancy experience but I gotta drop this album,” she wrote in the caption. Although the “Ex For a Reason” R&B star didn’t explicitly say she and her beau were working on a baby of their own, their PDA signaled that it definitely could be a possibility!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K5t77DZqehmaKWvKl5k25vcWlhbnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
