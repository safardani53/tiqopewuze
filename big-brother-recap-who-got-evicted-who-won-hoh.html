Brett resolved to use the news to his advantage ahead of the eviction.&nbsp;</p><p>Brett then got in the hammock with Haleigh and tried everything he could to get her vote. She lied, saying that she would be keeping him in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>While that was going down, Faysal walked around the house and kept checking to make sure Brett and Haleigh were not kissing or something.&nbsp;</p><p>It was ridiculous. He was acting as though he owned Haleigh and that she was going against him by speaking with another houseguest.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/haleigh-broucher-829x1024.jpg><p>Haleigh was open with Brett about there being no showmance between her and Faysal, so it’s going to be fun to see how that pans out.&nbsp;</p><p>We then took a trip outside the house to watch Swaggy C make his way to Bayliegh’s family home to meet them for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>It went well, and he could be calling them his family if he and Bayliegh can make it work outside the house. The family and Swaggy agreed that Tyler was the one to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>At the live eviction, Rachel was positive in her approach when addressing her fellow houseguests, telling them to vote with their heart and that if she can benefit them, she will try her best.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/rachel-swindler-839x1024.jpg><p>We wish we could say the same for Brett, but he went for the jugular. He said that Rachel was the ringleader of a female alliance that was intent on taking the men out of the house.&nbsp;</p><p>He went on to expose Bayliegh’s power, but he made sure to say that it was for "next week."&nbsp;</p><p>These losers are going to think Rachel was lying all along when Bayliegh refuses to use it.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>RS votes to evict: Brett&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Angela votes to evict: Rachel&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Kaycee votes to evict: Rachel&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Scottie votes to evict: Brett&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Tyler votes to evict: Rachel&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Sam votes to evict: Rachel&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Faysal votes to evict: Brett&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>JC votes to evict: Rachel&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Haleigh votes to evict: Brett</li></ul><p><strong>Rachel was evicted by a vote of 5-4!</strong></p><p>Rachel stormed out of the house as soon as the vote was announced.
