The&nbsp;America’s Got Talent host shared the behind the scenes clip to her Instagram on Tuesday August 24. She clearly thought the mistake was hilarious, when she included laughing and crying emojis in her caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The fan-filmed clip showed Heidi sitting in her chair, during a day of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AGT</a> filming. Her fellow judge&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sofia Vergara</a>,</strong> 49, was standing up to take a photo. The&nbsp;Modern Family actress waved Heidi and comedian&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Howie Mandel</strong></a>, 65, to take a selfie together. Heidi and Sofia both looked gorgeous, rocking a frilly orange dress and a strapless pink gown, respectively. Unfortunately, Heidi seemed to forget how short her skirt was when she leaned across the desk to take a selfie, because her backside was seen by fans, as she took the photo with her co-stars. Heidi didn’t seem bothered at all and joked about it in her caption. “Note to self ….. don’t bend over in a short skirt,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s nice that Heidi was able to poke fun at herself. The model has shared plenty of behind-the-scenes videos, where she gets silly and dances on the&nbsp;AGT set. The videos occasionally only feature her, but she’s also tapped other judges to take part in her behind-the-scenes antics. On Wednesday August 25, she posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>short clip</a> of herself and Sofia clinking beers together in what looks like a dressing room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Heidi-Klum-Laughs-Wardrobe-Malfunction-AGT-NBC-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Other than working on the latest season of&nbsp;AGT, Heidi has had a very fun and eventful summer. At the beginning of August, her and her husband, Tokio Hotel musician&nbsp;<strong>Tom Kaulitz</strong>, enjoyed a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantic getaway to Italy</a>, where the couple both relaxed and had fun. Heidi gave fans a peak into what their vacation was like, as she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared photos</a> of some of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stunning bikinis</a> and also posted series of photos of herself <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>riding on a jetski.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FwZqGdmZm2brfLrqRmmZeperit0Z2pqJqVYrqiuMWupZysmaS7bsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
