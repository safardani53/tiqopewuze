He’s well-educated</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Austin attended the University of Notre Dame for 2010-2011, then briefly transferred to Vanderbilt University for one year. He wound up back at Notre Dame for his junior year, and graduated in 2014 with a degree in TV/Film & Theater — and Taylor was proudly at the graduation ceremony. Notre Dame and Vanderbilt are INCREDIBLE schools and&nbsp;not easy to get into, so Austin definitely has some brains.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. He loves photography</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 23-year-old’s Instagram page features many artsy shots, and he’s taken up the hobby professionally, too. Not only does Austin reportedly freelance for a photography company, but he shot his big sis in a shoot for&nbsp;People&nbsp;magazine back in 2009…when he was just 16 years old!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3. He’s an actor</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Austin starred in Notre Dame’s theater productions while he was in college, and now, he’s headed for the big screen. His debut movie,&nbsp;I.T., in which he’ll star alongside <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pierce Brosnan</a></strong>,&nbsp;is in post-production and slated to come out later this year. His IMDB page also reports he has a role in&nbsp;Live By Night, a movie written by, directed by and starring&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ben Affleck</a></strong>. Certainly not a bad start in Hollywood!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>[jwplatform EnxYwiDL]</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>4. He’s totally protective and supportive of his big sis</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Besides accompanying her to big-time events, including, most recently, the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, and promoting her work on social media, Austin has very publicly stood up for Taylor in one of her biggest feuds. After&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kanye West</a></strong>, 38, released a song claiming he made Tay famous, Austin retaliated by sharing a video of himself throwing his Yeezy sneakers into the trash! LOL!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>5. He’s pretty hilarious!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Just go <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>read his Twitter page</a> — he doesn’t tweet often, but when he does, you’re bound to chuckle!</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>,&nbsp;are you totally obsessing over Austin like us?! Do you think he and Selena would make a good couple?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH10e49qZrCgn2K2tHnArqqtoZ5iwLi1xa1krZmpobyzecGrpq2glad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
