Having to ask for money, my coin <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> never had enough money to buy a coffee. I ran without my personal belongings that weeks before the incident [were] being hidden from me like: clothes, make up, perfume and important papers.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/90-Day-Fiances-Larissa-Dos-Santos-Lima-Isnt-Being-Deported.jpg><p>Dos Santos Lima noted that while many might believe “it reads as silly” to be upset about leaving behind material things, she “could never have” those same items in her home country. She later revealed that she would not be sent back to Brazil <a href=#>after she was arrested</a> by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in September 2020.</p><p>“The plan to provoke me and have me deported failed,” she wrote. “Thank God for the mercy of the American people and my amazing lawyer Adam. Because of their encouragement, kindness and hard work, I’m staying. To all of you that have shown me endless mercy, understanding and kindness, I promise you that I will give you more reasons to believe in me.”</p><p>The TLC personality’s legal troubles began in 2018 when she was <a href=#>arrested twice for domestic violence</a>: once days before her June wedding to Johnson, 35, and again in November. Charges were dismissed after her first arrest and <a href=#>she was not charged</a> over the second incident. Dos Santos Lima later accused the Las Vegas native of being unfaithful <a href=#>after receiving an Instagram DM</a> that alleged he was “sending d–k pics to other women.” Johnson addressed the rumors via social media at the time, noting that he took “responsibility” for making mistakes in his marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/90-Day-Fiances-Larissa-Dos-Santos-Lima-Isnt-Being-Deported-1.jpg><p>In January 2019, <a href=#>Johnson filed for divorce</a> after Dos Santos Lima was arrested for a third time following another domestic battery dispute. At the time, Dos Santos Lima was released on bail and<a href=#> appeared in court</a> four months later. “After consulting with her immigration attorney, this negotiation will not impede her ability to obtain citizenship,” a lawyer told Us Weekly in May 2019 after her charges were set to be reduced to disorderly conduct.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Drama continued to follow Dos Santos Lima when she was arrested and <a href=#>taken into custody by ICE officers</a> in September 2020. “We have no clue why. I want to let her family, fans and friends know that we are going there right now and as soon, as I have more info I will keep you guys posted. Send prayers,” the reality TV star’s friend <strong>Carmen Nys</strong> informed fans in an Instagram Story at the time.</p><p>A rep for Dos Santos Lima told TMZ at the time that lawyers were “working meticulously” on her release and “clearing up this misunderstanding” before <a href=#>she was eventually let go</a> and returned home to Colorado.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqtrdGiqqyZXZm8tHnSmqWtp6Niuaq5wGagrKakYq%2Bmtc2gZJ2doKS%2FtbHDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
