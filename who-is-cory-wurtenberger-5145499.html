At just 21 years old,<strong> Cory Wurtenberger</strong> is the youngest contestant competing in season 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cory-Wurtenberger-5-things-big-brother-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Even though he’s a youngster, Cory has some training when it comes to being strategic. He’s also the second Wurtenberger to compete in a CBS reality series.<strong> HollywoodLife</strong> has 5 key things you need to know about Cory as season 25 unfolds.</p><h2>Cory’s brother was on Survivor.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Cory is the younger brother of Survivor season 42 cast member <strong>Zach Wurtenberger</strong>. Zach was the first to be voted out of the game. Cory has his brother’s full support ahead of Big Brother season 25 getting underway.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“When a Wurtenberger turns 21, he embarks on his journey to the CBS studio lot,” Zach wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “SO beyond proud of my brother for making his dream come true despite it seeming LITERALLY impossible. Seriously. This isn’t just a big deal, this is unprecedented. Tune into #BB25 this fall to watch him redeem the Wurtenberger name.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He’s not the only relative of a Survivor alum competing in season 25. <strong>Jared Fields</strong> is the son of Survivor legend<strong> Cirie Fields.</strong></p><h2>Cory is in college.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cory is currently a third-year student at Vanderbilt University. He is a double major in political science and communication studies, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. He’s also a senior editor for the Vanderbilt Political Review and president of the university’s forensics team.</p><h2>Cory has a “straightforward” strategy when it comes to Big Brother.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Cory has already thought about how he’s going to play the game once he’s moved into the Big Brother house. Don’t underestimate Cory because of his age.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I’m going to try to lower my threat level as much as I can,” he said in the Diary Room, which you can see in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Exclusive with Sharon Tharp’s</a> “First Impressions of the New Cast” video. “That being said, try to win the first HOH. If it doesn’t happen, I’m entering full ‘I’m a child. Help. Lead me. What do I do? Where do I go? I don’t know how to do laundry. Do you know how to fold a shirt?’ Once I enter that mode, I think people will start looking at me as someone they can bring along as opposed to someone who is going to be this massive force they need to oppose.”</p><h2>Cory works as a private coach.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Cory works for 3P Speech, a company offering private coaching for middle/high school speech and debate. For 5 years, Cory has worked as a private coach for high school speech. “Coaching through 3P allows me to, in a way,&nbsp; give back to the community that I owe so much to. Oratory and Info are special events and I would love nothing more than to help people find their voices within them,” Cory wrote in his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>3P Speech bio</a>.</p><h2>Cory is from Florida.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Cory was raised in Weston, Florida. When he’s attending Vanderbilt, he’s based in Nashville. In Cory’s free time, he loves “<span>playing golf, hanging out with friends, and public speaking,” according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanderbilt Political Review bio</a>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KwsL7YZq6uqqSau6Ox0aCcq2VlZoF2gJhyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
