I would be a dad. I wanted to be the best Dad I could be. It was the most confusing period that I had ever experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>"My family was happy because there was going to be an addition to our family. Well during the latter part of October Mercedes would complain about stomach pains that gradually got worse.”</p><p>“On 10/28/2020 we rushed her to the hospital. Because I wasn’t the husband I couldn’t go to the room due to Covid, but after a time I managed to get to the back. When I got there I was met with cold silence.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000640611610.png><p>“I found out that she had a miscarriage! I had never been through this before so I didn’t know what feelings were normal and what was abnormal all I know is it felt like a funeral.”</p><p>Fans have questioned if Mercedes was actually pregnant, as did Paige on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris continued to write: “I wrestled with posting this, but this is real life. Not that an explanation is owed, but we do have MyChart documents that detail the day the pregnancy results came back from the doctor on 8/31/2020 and all paperwork regarding the miscarriage on 10/28/2020.”</p><p>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Married at First Sight</a>, Paige remained committed to their marriage and vowed to be a stepmother to his baby, as Chris expressed his desire to stay married as well.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000640611248.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000640611249.png><p>But when the honeymoon was over, Chris admitted he still had feelings for his ex and didn’t want another man to raise his child.&nbsp;</p><p>He then took a trip to Chicago alone to clear his head.&nbsp;</p><p>When he returned home to his wife, he asked her for a divorce.</p><p>On last week's episode, Paige sat down with both Chris and Mercedes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000640611252-1.png><p>Paige said: “My intentions were pure and all of that was interceded with this news. A baby is a blessing. I had told him… I was willing to support him in spite of all of that. But when you say, 'Hey the mother of my child is still in love with me and I have feelings for her, I don’t want to raise my child in a separate household, it can seem duplicitous to be honest.”</p><p>Mercedes then clarified that her intentions are to not “work things out” with Chris.&nbsp;</p><p>Paige questioned in her confessional: “If you’re not reconciling things with the mother of your child, then what was the real reason we’re getting a divorce? Did you try to make things work out with her and now this is a shock for both parties here?”</p><p>Chris then said he was “irritated.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000640611247-1.png><p>He added in his confessional: “This conversation is not accomplishing anything that I intended… Paige has her guns out and is firing shots. Insinuating her intentions were pure and my intentions were impure.”</p><p>Chris then walked out of the room, as Paige said the relationship “no longer serves” her and that she is okay to “walk away.”</p><p>Chris and Paige’s marriage has been rocky from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>On their wedding day, Chris admitted he called off his engagement only months prior.&nbsp;</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Married at First Sight's Mercedes says she does not want Chris Williams back</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Despite having sex multiple times on their honeymoon, Chris <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to Paige that he is not attracted to her.</a>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Chris also got into arguments with multiple cast members throughout the honeymoon.&nbsp;</p><p>Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000640611250.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZGyFdYOSaKSaqqKesqV5wK1kn6GiqMFuv8ign61lk52%2Fqr%2BMsKClpJmWurR5xLFkpqGjmK6zvsianp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
