On Facebook, comedian Eric Schwartz posted a photo of David with the caption:</p><p>“For many years, De La Soul struggled to reclaim the rights to their songs. Trugoy the Dove, nicknamed Dave, dies just as they do. De La Soul was a creative force that revolutionized people’s perceptions of what “rap” might be. A great trailblazer and icon. Thank you very much, Plug 2.”</p><p>Quest Green, a motivational speaker, also shared his sorrow on Facebook, writing:</p><p>“Man… I am heartbroken by the loss of yet another dear brother. David Jode Jolicoeur, nicknamed Plug Two, or Trugoy the Dove of De La Soul… Thank you for the music, but much more so for the memories. #delaforlife #dematlantadayzandnights.”</p><p>While the reason for his death has not been confirmed, Trugoy has previously talked about his health issues, specifically congestive heart failure.</p><h2>In the Royalty Capes music video from 2017, Trugoy the Dove discussed his health difficulties.</h2><p>Trugoy had been fighting congestive heart illness for a long time, which has hampered his career by forcing him to miss most of his De La Soul concerts.&nbsp;Trugoy discussed his heart failure in the music video for De La Soul’s debut hit, Royalty Capes, in 2017.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Trugoy-the-Dove-1.jpg alt="Trugoy the Dove" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>David was featured in the film at his home in suburban Maryland, where he talked about his life and what it was like to live with a vest that protects him from congestive heart failure.
