He’s waved custody and his name is no longer on Danielle’s birth certificate.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Mostly because he doesn’t want to pay child support anymore.</p><p>TMZ&nbsp;suggests that Danielle (or, rather, her mother) paid Ira an unknown sum to make the agreement and go away instead of leveraging his parental rights to make life difficult.</p><p>How much, however, is unknown. But considering how much Danielle is making, there are a lot of possibilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Danielle&nbsp;Bregoli&nbsp;became famous at 13 for telling Dr. Phil’s audience to "cash her&nbsp;ousside," indicating that she wanted to physically confront them for laughing at her.</p><p>Now, at 14, she has a budding music career under the name&nbsp;Bhad&nbsp;Bhabie.</p><p>Her charmingly titled song, "Hi&nbsp;Bich," features some interesting lyrical confessions:</p><p>"But now I’m breaking records and I’m making history/Why can’t they stop me?

There are worse ways to parent than being absent, folks.</p><p>And Danielle has accused her father of only speaking up in her life to ask if his daughter’s success means that he can stop paying child support … and to see if he can ride her coattails and get a share of her riches.</p><p>(Anyone reminded of Justin Bieber’s father?)</p><p>Ira was also outspoken about condemning Danielle Bregoli’s behavior. In private, that sounds reasonable. In public, however, it’s not really appropriate for a parent to speak about their minor child like that.</p><p>Besides, many believe that he only said that as a warning shot — that he might try to interfere with Danielle’s career if he didn’t get a cut of her earnings.</p><p>It sounds like, as shameful as his absence from her life was, Danielle is better off without him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p><a href=#>Danielle Bregoli was sentenced</a> for the same misdemeanors that got her on Dr. Phil’s show in the first place — and, ultimately, made her famous.</p><p>She’s on probation, and will remain on probation for a surprising number of years.</p><p>It’s tempting to point to Bhad Bhabie as a target of ridicule, or to lament that the new version of the "American Dream" that she’s living out is a nightmare.</p><p>But when you look at where she comes from — her parents, but also Florida as a concept — this music career is an opportunity for her to escape what would have essentially been a doomed life.</p><p>Let’s hope that she makes the most of it.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2FcLDAp6CepJyaeqO%2BxKCmpaFdnnqlu82tZKGZppp6onnDmptmmZ6uurC%2BxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
