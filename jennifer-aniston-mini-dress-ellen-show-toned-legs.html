The gorgeous actress ditched her jeans for a fitted, long-sleeve black mini dress that had a super short hem, flashing her long, lean legs. Jennifer’s dress came as such a surprise, considering we usually see Jen in either jeans and a T-shirt or a pantsuit. The dress was covered in a subtle floral pattern and featured long sheer sleeves with wide, billowy cuffs, while the rest of the frock was a bit fitted. The hem of the dress was trimmed in a pretty ruffle and ended high up on her thighs, revealing her amazing toned, tanned legs. She topped her look off with a bold pair of dangly earrings and sexy black strappy heels with silver studs. As always, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer’s hair</a> was done down and straight in a perfect blowout.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Lately, Jennifer has been switching up her style from casual white sneakers and jeans, to sky-high heels and trendier denim. Just the other day, she was shopping at the <strong>Ron Herman</strong> store in West Hollywood on May 30, when she rocked a pair of high-waisted, dark-wash <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baggy jeans</a> with a long-sleeve gray T-shirt tucked into the front. The way she accessorized her look is what pulled the outfit together, as she wore a thick brown leather belt with a chunky gold clasp on the front and a pair of black leather pointy-toed booties with insanely high heels. She topped her look off with a few delicate layered gold necklaces, gold and black square sunglasses, and a perfect blowout.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>We were totally shocked by the look because Jen usually steps out in a pair of low-rise baggy boyfriend jeans with a t-shirt tucked in, a pair of white sneakers, and sometimes a sweater or jacket. So, when she stepped out in trendy high-waisted culotte jeans with lining down the back of the legs, and a pair of sky-high heels, we were seriously impressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jennifer-aniston-ellen-dress-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Not only did Jennifer look flawless on Ellen, but she also chatted about everything from not feeling ashamed to go naked for the June/July issue of Harper’s Bazaar and possibly having a Friends reboot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH13e49uZqOdnqO2p7HRZpinoaOpvK95zKKlomWUp7K0v4yeo6WdnmLAqbvWZquoppWZeq2xxqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
