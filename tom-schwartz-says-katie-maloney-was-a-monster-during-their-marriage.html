She was always getting in tiffs and she’s like, You’re with me or against me,'” Schwartz, 40, said during the Wednesday, April 5, appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>. “She demanded unconditional loyalty early on.”</p><p>The TomTom co-owner noted that Maloney, 36, <a href=#>“put a lot of work” into adjusting</a> her behavior.</p><p>“She’s way better now. Katie, I love you but in the beginning, she was kind of a monster,” he continued. “She was a monster. She has had a falling out with every single person in her life multiple times. And I just didn’t like getting dragged into all that and I guess I became a little numb when she actually did need me it’s like the boy who cried wolf.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Schwartz-Says-Ex-Wife-Katie-Maloney-Was-a-Monster-Who-Cried-Wolf-Throughout-Their-Marriage-Feature-01.jpg><p>After follow guest <strong>John Lowe</strong> questioned his use of the term monster, Schwartz played dumb about saying the word twice and <a href=#>called his former spouse an “angel.”</a></p><p>Maloney, for her part, took to social media to call out Schwartz, <a href=#>tweeting</a>, “I was called a monster too many times to count… tonight’s #wwhl didn’t phase me. Sadly.”</p><p>The Minnesota native’s surprising comments came the same day that <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> viewers watched the former couple attempt <a href=#>to address their issues on screen</a>. In a new episode, Maloney <a href=#>got emotional while discussing the distance</a> between her and Schwartz after their split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Schwartz-Says-Ex-Wife-Katie-Maloney-Was-a-Monster-Who-Cried-Wolf-Throughout-Their-Marriage-01.jpg><p>“The only thing I could ever come up with [on why Schwartz is never on my side] is just that he just didn’t like me. He might have loved me, but he just didn’t like me,” she said after getting in an argument with her then-estranged husband.</p><p>Schwartz, however, claimed that Maloney <a href=#>was to blame for their past problems</a>. “You abused the wife, husband card. You can’t pull it 16 times a day,” he said. “I was a great f—king husband. I am going to tell you why I didn’t [defend you] more often toward the end of our marriage. Because you abused it early on.”</p><p>The former couple, <a href=#>who started dating ahead of the hit Bravo show</a>‘s debut in 2013, announced their decision to part ways before filming season 10. As cameras started rolling, Us Weekly confirmed in August 2022 that the bar owner got cozy with <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a> at <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brock Davies</strong></a>‘ wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tom-Schwartz-Says-Ex-Wife-Katie-Maloney-Was-a-Monster-Who-Cried-Wolf-Throughout-Their-Marriage-Feature.jpg><p>While Schwartz and Leviss’ <a href=#>flirtatious romance was explored</a> on the show, news broke off screen that the California native, 28, had an affair with <strong>Tom Sandoval</strong>. Us confirmed in March that Sandoval, 40, and <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong> </a>called it quits due to his infidelity.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Schwartz revealed <a href=#>what he knew about the situation</a> during his WWHL appearance, saying, “I learned about the affair in August. The one-night stand was in August and then it became, from my point of view, it became an emotional affair. Which is still inappropriate, but I didn’t think it was linear. [Then] in January, he came to me and told me that he was in love with Raquel.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET. Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen airs Sundays through Thursday nights on Bravo, and is available next day on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51iwKS01pqprbJdqK66v4ykmK2hlWK6orjOp5yyZaeWwG6tjKamp6ukmr9usNSroKefXam1prXRZqSaqqKerqixjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
