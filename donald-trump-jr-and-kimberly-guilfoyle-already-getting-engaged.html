People on both sides of the aisle agree that they deserve each other, but each side says that with very different meaning.</p><p>Guilfoyle has already signed on to work to get Trump reelected, quitting her job at Fox News where she was doing the exact same thing.</p><p>But in a brand new photo that she shared, she stands with Don Jr. while wearing a conspicuously large ring. Are … are they engaged?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Back in March, <a href=#>Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from Don Jr</a>. after weeks of speculation and eye-opening reports that their marriage was on its last leg.</p><p>A couple of months later, Don Jr. starts dating Kimberly Guilfoyle, which actually makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Female Fox News hosts seem to be required to be attractive — a requirement that does not extend to their male colleagues — and, of course, aggressively conservative.</p><p>Guilfoyle is both, making her a great match.</p><p>And it looks like Don Jr. was a perfect partner for her, too — and good for her! Not everybody wants a partner who’s smart or handsome or law-abiding.</p><p>But … if they’re just dating, what is she doing with this huge ring?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"A winning team!" Guilfoyle declared in the captions.

"But they don’t care."</p><p>Well, if the Trump family cared about public opinion, a lot of things would be different.</p><p>"They want to get engaged right away," the insider dishes. "And are only waiting for his divorce from Vanessa to come through."</p><p>Well, they can do what they like with their lives, we suppose.</p><p>And, for the record, even <a href=#>Vanessa Trump has defended the fact that they’re dating</a>. Though … we do wonder how she’ll feel about such a speedy engagement.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>17 Celebrities Who Actually Support Donald Trump</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcLDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z2ahq2WRo7Fut8immZ6qnK56qMHIpZ2osZyaeqK40Z6YnbFdnLK1wMinnmadnpyuqLHDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
