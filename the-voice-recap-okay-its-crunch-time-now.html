The judges seemed to take a shine to the performance, but he chose one of those songs that almost everyone likes. It was not entirely the best song to open the show with, but it was still an alright performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Will it be enough to send Hunter to the finals? I’m not so sure. It all comes down to the other performances on the night.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Vanessa Ferguson and Chris Blue</strong></p><p>In an effort to fill the two-hour slot the show paired some of the contestants up for performances. Vanessa and Chris went with "If I Ain’t Got You" by Alicia Keys.&nbsp;</p><p>They actually sang together really well. Like, it could pass for a professional duet. I don’t know whether that’s a testament to Alicia Keys or them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/gwen-stefani-smiles-on-the-voice-season-13.jpg><p><strong>TSoul</strong></p><p>TSoul&nbsp;went with "Ain’t No Way" by Aretha Franklin. This was a surprisingly lackluster performance for him. He’s been so strong all season long and did not choose the right time to falter.&nbsp;</p><p>It resulted in him screeching the final verse. It was not good. Will he be saved? I’m not so sure.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brennley Brown</strong></p><p>Brennley went with "Suds in the Bucket" by Sara Evans. It was great. Brennley has proven time and time again that she has the vocal chops to succeed in any situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Blake and Gwen were quick to pick out the flaws, but it was good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hunter Plake and Aliyah Moulden</strong></p><p>The second team up of the night performed "Let It Go" by James Bay. No, it was not the song from Frozen, and we are so thankful for that.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a horrible performance. Both performers just don’t sound good together, and that’s a shame.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/blake-shelton-is-ready-for-battle.jpg><p><strong>Lauren Duski</strong></p><p>Lauren went with "Ghost in this House" by Shenandoah. It was a riveting performance that showed off her vocal range.</p><p>Should Lauren advance to the final? Definitely.</p><p><strong>TSoul and Jesse Larson&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This duo went with "I Wish" by Stevie Wonder. Like the duo performance that came before it, it was terrible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris Blue</strong></p><p>Chris went with "Take Me to the King" by Tamela Mann. It was so much better than some of his recent performances. Everything about it was great, and I can’t wait until he makes it to the finale.</p><p><strong>Vanessa Ferguson&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Vanessa being in the bottom three last week was just uncalled for. She has been a solid competitor all season long, and there were others who should have been in the bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>This week, she performed "Superstar" by Luther Vandross. It was another solid performance that proved why she was still on the show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/adam-levine-poses.jpg><p><strong>Brennley Brown and Lauren Duski</strong></p><p>A poor song choice ruined this performance. They went with "A Good Hearted Woman" by LeAnn Rimes. The two country women should have turned in a solid performance, but it was all over the place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jesse Larson&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Jesse went with "I Was Wrong" by Chris Stapleton. It was not that great. At this stage, it should have been much better. It was all over the place, and he will probably wind up in the bottom three.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aliyah Moulden</strong></p><p>Aliyah went with "I Can Only Imagine" by MercyMe, and it was a solid performance. It was slower, but it complimented her voice well.&nbsp;</p><p>She should make it to the finale.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of the performances?</p><p>Sound off below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Reality TV Star Salaries: Who Makes the Most?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WCcMDHnmSvp5mYsm6%2BxJyYqWWfoK66ecitqmaboqq7pLSMraCmnV2jvLh7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
