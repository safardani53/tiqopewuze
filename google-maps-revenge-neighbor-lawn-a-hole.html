We can't choose them and its a coin flip on what you're going to get. Sometimes, you can get some really amazing people that you forge life long friendships with, even when one of you moves away. But that is probably few and far between. Most likely, your neighbor probably doesn't necessarily share the same values and beliefs as you do, and that is putting it mildly. Sometimes, it really might create a situation of extreme tension and sometimes, when acting on that tension, some very interesting things happen. We can't help the way we feel and we definitely can't help the way we react to those feelings, especially when someone could live about 100 feet away.</p><p>A<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> post</a> on Reddit is blowing up featuring an image of petty revenge, seemingly exacted by an angry neighbor via lawnmower. The picture posted shows some words sculpted lovingly into the grass, with an arrow pointing at the accused.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>This isn't even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first time </a>someone has found a picture of the angry grass clippings on Google Maps, and there is even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a story</a> about the longstanding feud in the local paper, Peninsula Daily News. The lawn and the house it's mad at are located in Sequim, WA. The neighbor built a multi-car garage with an apartment on top, then painted the whole thing bright purple. The PDN <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> a photo, and personally I think it looks nice, but people around the house complain it reflects lavender light into their homes. I guess....that's bad?</p><p>The house was built in 2009, and the lawn was mowed a few years later and is still visible today! So either someone is maintaining it, or they salted the earth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Google Maps</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Everyone's got theories and questions about it:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Back in 2009, the purple house was being petitioned against, with locals asking for tax relief from Clallam County Assessor Pam Rushton, claiming the color of the house devalued their property. These are pretty huge plots of land, but it seems like these people couldn't just leave well enough alone. One resident told PDN they call it the "purple people-eater" or compare it to Barney the Dinosaur. Guess the name calling has escalated?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLyws8ueZKaZoKh6s7HVnqWgnV2jsqqzx5umq2WclsSvecBmn6iklQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
