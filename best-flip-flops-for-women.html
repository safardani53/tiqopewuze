Fear not, we've tested the best flip flops for women.</p><p>Let's face it, they're the easiest shoe to wear out there. But everyone hates flip flops that break after a couple of uses or just aren't comfortable. The whole point of a flip flop is basically comfort.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1188412603.jpg><p>If you're lucky enough to be jetting off to a beach or maybe you live somewhere sandy, then you might just need a lovely new pair of flip flops.</p><p>Well actually, we just like wearing flip flops in the garden – who can be bothered to struggle with shoe laces just to sit at home?</p><p>They might not have the best street cred around but there are actually lots of pretty pairs in shops now, from vibrant prints to logomania gems.</p><p>To help you find your new faves, we've tested out the best flip flops for women to shop in 2021. And with our reviews, honesty is the best policy.</p><p>This article and featured products have been independently chosen by Sun journalists.

Best comfy flip flops: <strong>Crocs Unisex's Crocband Flip Flop</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/71ugiYr073L._AC_UX695_.jpg><li><strong>(AD) Crocs Unisex's Crocband Flip Flop, from £12.59 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Ever since we got these, we haven't taken them off at home. Who knew Crocs' flip flops would be even more comfy than their trending style?</p><p>There are over 70 (!) colours to choose from on Amazon but we opted for hot pink and the colour is even brighter than the picture makes out.</p><p>The grip studded base feels great on your feet as well as the slightly raised under-toe supportive border, all keeping your tootsies securely in place.</p><p>Unlike some flip flops, they have a gripped base too, which means you can wear them on any surface without slipping over.</p><p>All in all, these are definitely our favourite on the list for comfort. Let's make Crocs cool forever.</p><h2>2. Best classic flip flops: <strong>Havaianas Women’s Slim</strong> flip flops</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-file.jpg><li><strong>(AD) Havaianas Women’s Slim, from £21.89 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Havaianas are a classic on the summer shoe scene, and they qualify for Prime next-day delivery on Amazon (hey last minute holiday shoppers).</p><p>Starting from just £21.89, the Havaianas Slim comes in six designs but the tonal Rose Gold ticks off this season's beige colour palette craze so well.</p><p>From the textured sole to the elegantly thin straps and Havainas branding, you can't really fault these as a durable pair of flip flops.</p><p>They're not only pretty, but they're also great quality so we can imagine digging these out for years of BBQs, beaches and all things summery.</p><p>Our only flaw is that if you have wide feet then the bridge section of the shoe might be a little too narrow for you.</p><h2>3. Best fashion flip flops: <strong>Rocket Dog Women's Eden Flip Flop</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spotlight_tampa_leopard_natural_002_1024x1024@2x-e1620981945178.jpg><ul><li><strong>Spotlight Leopard Print Flip-Flops, £20 from Rocket Dog - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you're after a pair that look and feel good on your feet then you'll definitely want to check out Rocket Dog's flip flop selection.</p><p>For £20, the Eden Flip Flops come in a Carole Baskin-approved wild cat print style with thick straps and a sturdy black base.</p><p>&nbsp;Unlike most flip flops, the sole isn't bendy at all yet it's slightly curved, giving you strong support with grip underneath too.</p><p>We can see these accessorising summer looks rather than just being thrown on at the pool or beach, especially as the textile straps aren't waterproof.</p><p>They're definitely more structured than your average flip flop, so you can easily wear them throughout those long summer days.</p><h2>4. Best sporty flip flops: <strong>Puma Unisex Adults Epic Flip V2 Beach and Pool Shoes</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/71ADhz9NMuL._AC_UL1500_.jpg><li><strong>(AD) Puma Unisex Adults Epic Flip V2 Beach and Pool Shoes, from £13.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Sporty flip flops are always a winner for sliding on post-swim. And Puma's Epic pair are just £13.99.</p><p>Complete with all-over Puma branding, from the strap to the base, these waterproof EVA-cushioned flip flops are a no-nonsense summertime staple.</p><p>There are quite a few colour-ways to choose from too. We tried out red and white and orange and blue, and both looked vibrant as ever.</p><p>The base is really flat and smooth with a gripped sole, so we'd probably keep these for practicality, i.e. wearing in-between swimming and sunning.</p><p>They're not the most on-trend flip flops that we've tested out but if you're on the look out for an easy-breezy, straightforward pair then go for these.</p><h2>5. Best flip flops for grip: <strong>Gumbies - Duckbill Flip-Flops</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/81e4AisgMbL._AC_UL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Duckbill Flip-Flops, from £20 from Gumbies - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Gumbies' Duckbill Flip Flops sport their trademark, recycled rubber sole that's basically got just as much grip as a pair of trainers.</p><p>Ok so, these aren't the prettiest pair of flip flops around, but they sure are sensible with a sturdy strap and curved base that fits your feet like a glove.</p><p>They. Are. So. Comfy. We didn't want to take them off, although because we don't think they look that good with any out-of-the-house outfits, we did.</p><p>The gripped sole is better than any flip flops we've ever worn, which means these are probably ideal for older women who want to feel safe and secure.</p><p>Are they cool? Absolutely not. Are they the comfiest shoes ever? Probably.</p><h2>6. Best eco flip flops: FoamLife's LIXI Beach Flip Flops</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FoamLife-FF1SS21101-Lixi-Sand_2.jpeg><ul><li><strong>LIXI Beach Flip Flops, £24.99 from FoamLife - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>FoamLife is a new brand that caught our eye for its simple premise: comfortable and affordable flip flops made from recycled materials and 100% plastic-free packaging. What's not to like?</p><p>Available in six shades, the Lixi has a recycled foam non-slip&nbsp;footbed, with a soft toe post and raised arch support that makes these super comfy—we've been able to go for long walks wearing ours, with no issues.</p><p>With a simple design that features just a small fabric label, we think these are ideal if you want a fuss-free sandal that's chic, comfortable and eco-friendly.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in sun selects</h2></p><p>Summer wardrobe shopping?
