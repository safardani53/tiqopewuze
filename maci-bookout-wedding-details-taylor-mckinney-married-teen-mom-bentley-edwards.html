In fact, she had a wedding planner make most of the tough decisions. But when it came to the personal touches — including incorporating her three kids: <strong>Bentley Edwards</strong>, 7, <strong>Jayde McKinney</strong>, 1, and <strong>Maverick McKinney</strong>, 4 months, into the ceremony, Maci knew exactly what she wanted!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform pAyflt4o]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>At the gorgeous family affair, which took place at Honey Lake Church in Greenville, Florida, little Bentley — whom Maci had with ex <strong>Ryan Edwards</strong> — was actually one of the stars of the whole day! The boy escorted Jayde, the flower girl, down the aisle while pulling their baby brother Maverick in a wagon. And as Taylor put it, the little guy served as his “mini best man.” SO precious!</p><h3>Celebrity Weddings: See Pics Of The Most Lavish Hollywood Nuptials&nbsp;</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Later at the reception, when the party REALLY got going, Bentley was “running around like crazy” when the DJ spun tunes such as <strong>Wiz Khalifa</strong>‘s “Taylor Gang” and <strong>Lil Wayne</strong>‘s “Lollipop.” “He was having a blast,” fellow Teen Mom star <strong>Catelynn Lowell</strong>, 24, told the publication. But Maci’s oldest wasn’t the only family member who made an impression on her special day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Family in general played a big role as Maci’s pastor grandfather officiated the “very traditional, religious ceremony,” the reality star said. And as the pair exchanged their rings, her brother <strong>Matt</strong> stood by Taylor as one of his groomsmen. On the other side, Taylor’s sister, <strong>Tara</strong>, was one of Maci’s bridesmaids. Also honoring her late grandmother whom she recently lost, Maci had a special locket sewn into her gown.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Maci was a gorgeous bride,” Catelynn gushed. And apparently her and Taylor’s self-written vows were tear-jerking as well. “Taylor talked about their family, but he would throw in jokes about football,” Catelynn continued. “Maci explained their story and how they met. She was getting teary!” Aw!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>We wish nothing but the best for these two, who are currently on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. “Eight days with no children and a beer and a beach — awesome,” Maci laughed before they left the reception. “I’d say by day five we’re probably going to be missing the kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — doesn’t Maci’s wedding sound super sweet? Do you love how she incorporated all three of her kids in the ceremony?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5xe5BrZqaZk556o7vOpKaurF2ssqWwyKeeZpyVqa6quNJmq5qxnKS%2FbrnCpKCnppWueq6t0augnpxdqbKmuoympqZlkpq7tbjEsmSenKeWv6W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
