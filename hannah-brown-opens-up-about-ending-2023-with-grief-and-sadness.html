She also hit a milestone in her romantic life.</p><p>In August 2023, she <a href=#>announced her engagement</a> to <strong>Adam Woolard</strong>, sharing a snap of her sparkling diamond ring. “So happy. I love our steady love,” she wrote via Instagram.</p><p>After Woolard popped the question, Brown admitted <a href=#>exclusively to Us Weekly</a> that she felt anxiety leading up to the engagement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bachelorettes-Hannah-Brown-Opens-Up-About-Ending-2023-With-%E2%80%98Grief-and-Sadness2.jpg><p>“I went back and forth, I was like, ‘Are you OK with us sharing our engagement story this way?’ Because if you’ve listened to the episode [of my ‘Better Tomorrow’ podcast], it is complicated,” Brown explained. “I kind of felt like, ‘Oh, my gosh, are people going to judge our relationship because it wasn’t this smooth, fairy-tale thing?’ And that’s what everybody seems to look like on social media when you see these posts. But it’s been so cool to be able to see the messages that I’m getting of, ‘This is how people actually feel.’ Most people who have gotten engaged are, like, not fully the way it always looks. There is some fear [and] there is some anxiety that goes on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When Woolard confessed his proposal plans to Brown, she admitted she had a “panic attack” which led to her sending an “emergency” email to her therapist with the subject line: “I NEED COUNSEL.” Ultimately, she told Woolard she did want to get engaged but didn’t want to “know” ahead of time.</p><p>Brown told Us that she felt “a little bit nervous about putting [the real story] out,” but noted it felt “really good” to receive messages thanking her for their honesty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZ6jrql5waumsKZdpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMnqWdoZ6cenN8kWxksKGknXqovsienWaZnpl6tK3Dp5ysq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
