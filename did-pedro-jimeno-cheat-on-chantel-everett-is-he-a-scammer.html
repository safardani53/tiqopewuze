There are so many potential explanations. What was the final straw?</p><p>Even before the divorce revelation, many had suspected Pedro of cheating.</p><p>Others think that this divorce was his plan all along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/06/the-family-chantel-trailer-11-chantel-has-flashbacks-1024x650.png><p>Chantel Everett and Pedro Jimeno had so much drama in their marriage and families that they got their own spinoff.</p><p>The Family Chantel walked so that Darcey and Stacey could run, so to speak.</p><p>But Pedro’s divorce filing hinted at something worse than family brawls or scheming sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/pedro-fights-with-the-family-chantel.gif><p>The same day as his filing for divorce, Pedro accused Chantel of funneling money out of their shared business account.</p><p>He alleged that she placed an ample six-figure sum into an account that she shares with her sister, Winter.</p><p>Pedro did not say this publicly, but asked the court for an emergency hearing on the matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The court denied Pedro’s motion for an emergency hearing, but will hold a hearing later in the summer.</p><p>However, Pedro and Chantel both received restraining orders.</p><p>Simply put, neither of them are allowed to do any shenanigans with money or marital property while the divorce is pending.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to Pedro, Chantel removed the money in April … days before the date of separation.</p><p>It sounds like things were going south, and they both knew it. Fans have known it for a long time.</p><p>But without Chantel or Pedro speaking publicly on the matter, their followers are left to draw their own conclusions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On recent episodes of The Family Chantel, Pedro was a little too free with compliments when it came to his coworker.</p><p>Antonella has reportedly been in a relationship with a man named Daniel for years — almost as long as Pedro has been married.</p><p>But fans sensed a spark between the two of them. Even Chantel was alarmed by how close they were.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This flew in the face of how Pedro has spoken about his wife.</p><p>He has openly disparaged Chantel, particularly in terms of what she does around the house or in the yard.</p><p>Chantel actually gave Pedro a public callout while liveblogging this season … but that was before the world learned of their divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of course, this is hardly the first time that Pedro’s behavior has given Chantel reasons to doubt.</p><p>Coraima has been a family friend for years. His sister, at least, wanted to see them get together.</p><p>There were times when Pedro seemed to want that, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It is not unbelievable that Pedro would have an affair.</p><p>However, my gut says that if he is cheating, it’s probably not with a woman featured on the show.</p><p>Think about it — you’d want to hide your side piece from the cameras to avoid anyone connecting the dots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now, fans are buzzing that Pedro never really loved Chantel.</p><p>Many viewers see his family as schemers who are using him and Chantel for fame, reality TV money, and more.</p><p>The latest fan theory is simple: Pedro used Chantel for a green card.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Five years is a long time to remain married if you’re only there as a scam.</p><p>Some speculate that he remained married to Chantel because their reality TV fame lasted longer than he anticipated.</p><p>Others point out that he wanted to remain married to improve the chances of bringing his mom and sister to the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At this point, we have to acknowledge that the 90 Day Fiance fandom has a disturbing xenophobia problem.</p><p>While it’s less prevalent than the fandom’s racism or misogyny issues, it means a lot of unfounded “green card” accusations.</p><p>Yes, Pedro might be a cheater. He could even be a scammer. But it seems more likely that the marital drama was simply too much.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WEcLDInWSpnZSnvG62yKacp6ddmLWmrdNmpqdlk52ur8DEpWSerpWnsrXAjKKqZqCVYq5uv8KapKadomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
