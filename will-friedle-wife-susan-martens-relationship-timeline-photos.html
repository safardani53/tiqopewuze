The person who makes me laugh, giggle, smile every single day,” she captioned a September 2019 <a href=#>Instagram</a> tribute to the former child star. “You make me a better me. Thank you for loving me the way you do. It’s you and me, forever. I love you always&nbsp;<span class=s2>❤️</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Friedle and&nbsp;<span class=s1>Martens</span>&nbsp;have been linked since 2014, with the dog lover even praising the&nbsp;<i>My Date With the President’s Daughter&nbsp;</i>star’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Girl Meets World&nbsp;</i></a>cameo. (<i>Girl Meets World&nbsp;</i>was Friedle’s first live-action acting role in years after he previously stepped back from on-camera work <a href=#>due to an anxiety disorder</a>.)</p><p class=p1>“So proud of this guy,”&nbsp;<span class=s1>Martens</span>&nbsp;gushed via<a href=#> Instagram</a> in December 2014, sharing a behind-the-scenes snap of Friedle posing with former TV brother <a href=#><strong>Ben Savage</strong></a> on the set of the Disney Channel spinoff.</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Batman Beyond&nbsp;</i>alum and&nbsp;<span class=s1>Martens</span>&nbsp;— who shares daughter <strong>Lexi Zavad</strong> with a former partner — have kept their relationship relatively private, Friedle grew up with his love life making headlines. His&nbsp;<i>Boy Meets World&nbsp;</i>character, Eric Matthews, was <a href=#>notably a lothario upon the sitcom’s 1993 premiere</a>.</p><p class=p1>“<a href=#><strong>Rider [Strong]</strong></a> and I talk about one of the things [that bother us while rewatching the show] is the constant kissing,” the “Pod Meets World” podcast cohost <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;in August 2022</a>. “We were<a href=#> kissing girls every week</a> and it was kind of creepy the way it kept happening. And there was never a story that it’s not like the actresses had wonderful story lines. It was just, like, you are there to kiss us that week. It was really kind of gross.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “The <a href=#>first few episodes are pretty tough to watch</a>. … I clicked on Disney+ just to see some of the episode titles from the future seasons and I didn’t remember, like, 80 percent. So I know there’s gonna be things coming up [when Rider, <a href=#><strong>Danielle Fishel</strong></a> and I rewatch for our podcast] that none of us remember that we’re all gonna go, ‘Oh wow. That’s not a good thing at all.’”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for Friedle and&nbsp;<span class=s1>Martens</span>’ complete relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKq4y2adq6GVmbmmedainZ5lo6rAorqMppirrJWjwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
