I absolutely love charity shops but you should only donate really good quality items.</p><p>"When I work with clients, they’ll straight away go ‘give that to the charity shop’ and I’ll say ‘no it’s got stains on it, no-one is going to want that’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108569.jpg><p>"Before you even think about de-cluttering, you need to have a plan, because people tend to find it overwhelming.</p><p>"Write down on a notepad or your phone what areas you want to tackle in that space, and I always say to start small.&nbsp;</p><p>"Then get in your happy place, whack on some tunes, make sure you’ve got a drink and some snacks, light a candle. All of this brings us happy memories and reassures us.</p><p>"If you start to feel overwhelmed, singing, dancing, replenishing yourself or smelling a nice smell really does help.</p><p>"And remember, one tick off the list is better than none.</p><p>My mum taught me everything should have a home. This is just how I've been brought up. Mum doesn’t have clutter</p><span class=quote-credit>Nicola Lewis</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>46</span><p>"So if you do get dragged away by the kids or a phone call, you can go back to that list and think ‘right, I'll pick up from here’ or ‘I can tackle that tomorrow because at least I did that one task’.</p><p>"Praising and rewarding ourselves is a big part of it.</p><p>"The mistake most people make is saying ‘right, I’m going to do the wardrobe’ and emptying everything out on the bed because they’ve seen Marie Kondo do it.</p><p>"Then they’re thinking ‘how did I have so much stuff in that wardrobe? That doesn't make sense'.</p><p>"Overwhelm takes over, people start getting anxious and upset when they come across nostalgic items and memories. You need to break it up into smaller chunks."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108593.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108567.jpg><p>Nicola set up her business four years ago, after 15 years in investment banking and four years in private aviation with Harrods.</p><p>Having been made redundant, she decided to completely change careers and transfer her skills to professional home organising - teaching techniques like de-cluttering and colour coding.</p><p>In her own home, Nicola colour codes everything from her bookcase to her fridge pouches and puzzles.</p><p>I love colour coding, which I think is about control. When I come home, I like to have that feeling like when you walk into a hotel room, like ‘oh it’s so nice in here’</p><span class=quote-credit>Nicola Lewis</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>46</span><p>She says: "My mum taught me everything should have a home.

When I come home, I like to have that feeling like when you walk into a hotel room, like ‘oh it’s so nice in here’.</p><p>"I love that feeling and that’s something I'm very used to. My parents always tidied up on a Sunday and as teenagers we’d help.</p><p>"My girls have even colour coded their wardrobes. My youngest's only 12 years old and she's put all her blacks together, it looks like Zara.</p><p>"My older daughter’s room is perfect, I don’t even have to go in there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108478.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108568.jpg><p>"But they went through that stage of creating mess in the front room, which I didn't stress about. They’re kids, they’re having fun and at the end of the day, I can tidy up quickly as everything has a home.</p><p>"I like to show mess on my Instagram, because it makes people feel better.</p><p>"I find a lot of people have stuff out on the kitchen worktop, or by the front door, or stacked up at the bottom of the stairs. It’s about dealing with those.</p><p>"I can understand why clients feel overwhelmed if they haven’t got a place for things and they’re just moving them around.</p><p>"When people come over, they just collect the mess, throw it into a cupboard, shut the door and from the outside it looks nice.</p><p>"That was my mission right from the start, to show off the inside of my cupboards. That was the beginning of 'before and after' organising pics."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108475.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108570.jpg><p>Every Sunday, the Lewis family have a big tidy - nicknamed the 'Sunday sort out'.</p><p>Nicola says: "When I was working in the City, my home was pretty tidy because no-one was home.</p><p>"My children were either at childcare or with nannies. I had a cleaner and food deliveries, so everything was very automated.</p><p>I can understand why clients feel overwhelmed if they haven’t got a place for things and they’re just moving them around, throwing the mess in a cupboard. That was my mission right from the start, to show off the inside of my cupboards</p><span class=quote-credit>Nicola Lewis</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>46</span><p>"Sundays were just about putting things away then going out with our friends. Now it’s harder because I do work from home, we’re in our house a lot more and we don’t have a cleaner.</p><p>"So I delegate roles out on a Sunday, we all help and work together as a team. I think that’s really important, the kids get rewarded with pocket money.</p><p>"Whenever they’ve tidied or made their beds, we praise them so they do it again. That’s something I really encourage to my following.</p><p>"In the morning we’ll clean the windows, my husband loves vacuuming so that’s him sorted, the girls will do one bathroom each.</p><p>"I do 30 minutes of cleaning-a-day Monday to Saturday, we’ll hoover every day and wipe down the surfaces, then we do about two hours on a Sunday.</p><p>"Organising takes two to three hours a week. You’re not organising all the time because everything has a place."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Nicola's top tips</h3></p><li><strong>Find a home for everything:</strong> Repurposed shoe boxes and washing up capsules boxes can be made into free containers</li><li><strong>Colour code your belongings:</strong> To create control and a calming feel</li><li><strong>Make your bed:</strong> I always say to people when they move house, ‘the first thing you should do is make your bed’. Should you get overwhelmed, you have a calming space you can go into any time</li><li><strong>Make a plan before decluttering: </strong>And start small</li><li><strong>Make tidying fun: </strong>With music, snacks, a candle and a drink</li><li><strong>Don't chuck your clutter away:</strong> Donate or repurpose it</li><li><strong>Shop essentials: </strong>Homesense, Paperchase, Amazon, Wilkos, Argos and WH Smith all have great organising ranges. Label makers are essential for getting organised</li><li><strong>Get the kids involved: </strong>Reward them with pocket money and compliments so they have an incentive</li><li><strong>Clean every day:</strong> Then set aside Sunday morning for the bigger jobs</li><li><strong>Shop smart: </strong>Use fridge & freezer leftovers before buying more food</li><p>Nicola insists implementing a system will save you money in the long run, especially when it comes to food.</p><p>She says: "My snack station is brilliant for mums. You can use the kids' lunch boxes or another container, just put all their food for the day in there, from the age of about five.</p><p>"I started doing this during school holidays, because I was bored to death of the girls going 'I'm hungry', and I started doing it again at the beginning of lockdown.</p><p>"I was thriving, I had the whiteboard out, I was writing schedules, I had the snack boxes out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108590.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108476.jpg><p>"I have a 'use it up' drawer in the fridge too. I do a fridge edit once a week to see what’s expiring, then put everything in a clear drawer the family can look through when they're hungry, so there's no food waste.</p><p>"It saves me money too, I haven’t done a food shop for two weeks because I’ve been getting stuff out of the freezer.</p><p>"I have six freezer drawers, labelled ‘fish, meat, pizza, ice cream, fruit and veggies and vegan stuff’.</p><p>"When my husband or the kids are putting the food shop away, they know where everything goes.</p><p>"When I store mince, I'll whack it flat and put it in an eco bag before freezing, to keep it flat."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108484.jpg><p>Nicola says she's all about "practical over perfection". She adds: "I’ve worked in over 300 homes and they’ve all wanted something different.</p><p>"Only one client has ever asked for a Khloe Kardashian pantry, which does look a little bit unrealistic because everything is so sterile and perfect.</p><p>"But that’s how she wants to live her life and I can’t judge her for that. For me it’s just about making spaces functional so people can see and use what they’ve got."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654108592.jpg><p>Nicola spoke to Fabulous for a partnership with MINI, with whom she shared her car packing tips.</p><p>She says: “I use packing cubes for essentials and store them underneath the front passenger seat. Tissues, wet wipes, sick bags, sanitisers, face masks can all be stored neatly together.</p><p>“Use a small, soft velvet bean bag and get your child to fill it with their favourite soft toys and comforters, the things they will miss most from home.</p><p>"Not only will this keep them content, but this bag doubles up as a soft pillow for the journey and an additional toy bag to keep their new holiday bedroom tidy.</p><p>"Consider using soft luggage bags, as these can be manoeuvred into tight spaces inside your boot more easily than hard luggage cases.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>"If you’re still struggling for space inside the car boot, then vacuum bags are a fab solution and will save you time on folding too.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Having your handheld vacuum in the car will make this simple."</p><p><strong>With enough room to sit five comfortably, as well as plenty of space for everything from the family luggage to the pet pooch, the MINI Countryman is the perfect partner for staycations.
