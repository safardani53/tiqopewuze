But in showcasing her “decorated career” on social media, she’s also opening herself up to a new criticism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0807_rhony_11_brynnwhitfield-1024x576.png><p>Many RHONY 14 viewers have a simple stance: “I think that Brynn Whitfield should get to do whatever she wants.”</p><p>Is it because she’s hot? Yes. It is because she’s funny? Also yes.</p><p>She’s a genuinely likeable person. Too likeable, if you ask Erin Lichy. And if you ask some viewers … especially those who are perhaps a little uptight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0807_rhony_05_brynnwhitfield-1024x576.png><p>However, a recent story circulated, claiming that Brynn is a sugar baby or even an escort.</p><p>For the record, those are both types of sex work. There’s nothing wrong with sex work, but accusing someone of being a sex worker is weird — and the intentionally is usually to insult them.</p><p>Similarly, there’s nothing wrong with being a physics teacher. But if someone circulated rumors that Countess Luann is a physics professor at Duke University, that would be bizarre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0908_brynnwhitfield_ig_03-576x1024.jpg><p>On her Instagram Story this week, Brynn called out claims that she either works as an escort or otherwise goes on paid dates with rich men.</p><p>The thing is, it’s not just that those aren’t her lines of work.</p><p>Brynn has a career. It’s just not sex work. She’s a brand strategy specialist, and you’ve almost certainly seen some of her work over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0908_brynnwhitfield_ig_01.png><p>Brynn explained, bluntly, that she has disposable income because she makes a lot of money and doesn’t have a lot of expenses.</p><p>She’s not a CEO or company founder (like Jessel’s husband) or an already-famous boss like Jenna Lyons.</p><p>But she also isn’t married. And she doesn’t have kids. So when Brynn makes money, it goes to her — and her lifestyle. (Also, she was too polite to point this out, but it’s easier to dress nicely when you’re super mega hot)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0908_brynnwhitfield_ig_02-572x1024.png><p>Not content to stop there, Brynn also posted an Instagram Story showcasing her work history. This looks like an introduction from her resume.</p><p>The second most recognizable project on which she worked seems to have been a Dove Beauty campaign. That won awards!</p><p>But the most recognizable project wasn’t for a beloved company or bringing positivity to the world. She was “working on the BP Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0908_brynnwhitfield_ig_04-576x1024.jpg><p>Wait, what?</p><p>It appears that she was part of a PR campaign that tried to clean up British Petroleum’s image after one of the worst ecological disasters in the history of the planet.</p><p>You know the old South Park sketch where the head of BP is just in a seductive montage saying “We’re sorry” over and over? Well, that. Or the real version of that. Obviously not the South Park version.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0807_rhony_08_brynnwhitfield-1024x576.png><p>Is that … something about which to brag?</p><p>PR work isn’t always promoting a product. Sometimes it just means cleaning up a company’s image. In some cases (not BP, of course), something that a company didn’t even do.</p><p>Maybe a video game company recently worked with a streamer who blurted out a slur on stream. A PR crisis team plays cleanup. Maybe someone died in a parking lot right in front of a business. On a small scale, you send someone to reframe the tragedy so that your company name doesn’t appear in headlines about a corpse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0807_rhony_10_brynnwhitfield-1024x576.png><p>We’re not saying that there’s nothing wrong with a PR campaign to clean up the image of a massive, destructive company’s horrific blunder. It was a catastrophe.</p><p>But we can acknowledge that Brynn isn’t really the bad guy in this situation. Her employer was.</p><p>PR specialists have a job to do. If we as a society want to say that there are some things that no PR campaign should try to protect, perhaps we should write that into law.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WGcK7RsqWnZaedtrWyyJ6jnWWhqq60tMSsZKytl5a%2Fbq7Am7BmqqWivLO%2FjJqbpqGkqHq1u4ypqWain5d6qrrVqKOvoZ6ceqWxxKmumqyVp3qpu9GisaimXZm2tK3SrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
