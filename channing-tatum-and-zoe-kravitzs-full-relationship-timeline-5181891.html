And I don’t think we’ve ever seen him play someone dark. I’m excited to see him do that.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>At the end of February, Channing attended the premiere of <i>The Batman</i> to support her, as Zoë’s former stepdad,<b> Jason Momoa</b>, shared a picture of him and Channing to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“CHEEEEHUUUUUUUU.

That’s why I was drawn to him and wanted to meet with him. And I was right. … I think that’s exciting to watch someone who’s mostly played boy next door, good guy, love interest, all of that.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Later that month, the duo celebrated their first anniversary by jetting off to Italy together.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>November 2022</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>GQ</i></a>, Zoë revealed how she fell in love with Channing, calling him a “wonderful human.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“He makes me laugh, and we both really love art and talking about art and the exploration of why we do what we do,” she pointed out. “We love to watch a film and break it down, and talk about it and challenge each other.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The Los Angeles native also called the <i>Dear John</i> actor her “protector” while working on the set of their movie.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“Whether it was making me tea or pouring me a drink or going to whip someone into shape or whatever — he really was my protector, and it was really wonderful and sweet,” she said. “I think if you can do something like that together, it’s a good test. And we came out even stronger.”</p><h2>January 2023</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>During an interview with<i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Vanity Fair</a>,</i> Channing admitted to following several fan accounts dedicated to Zoë, joking that he has “no chill” and adding, “I was just seeing what she was up to!
