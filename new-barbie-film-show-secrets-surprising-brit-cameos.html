Thanks to Barbie, all the problems with feminism have been solved.”</p><p>Robbie plays “stereo-typical” Barbie. You know, the one you always imagine when you think of Barbie. She’s blonde, bronzed and beautiful.</p><p>Her life is practically perfect in every way, with glittery parties and dance routines with her fellow dolls in her <a href=#>Dreamhouse</a> and absolutely no sexual connection to Ken (<a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>), who is lovelorn.</p><p>That is until the person playing with her in the “real world” has dark thoughts that channel through to her vacuous brain.</p><p>While disco dancing in sequins, Barbie suddenly blurts out: “Do you ever think about dying?”</p><p>Her plastic-fantastic world comes crashing down even further when her tip-toe feet go flat and she has a small patch of cellulite on her thigh.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Film</h2></p><p>So in a bid to set herself free from any bleak brainwaves or inconvenient unattractiveness, Barbie jumps in her <a href=#>pink</a> convertible, along with Ken and her rollerblades, to visit the <span id=dd1a82a2-2ddf-4a0b-97e8-898bbb17f19f class=suggested-link>real</span> world and speak to the person who is playing with her.</p><p>This is where the film could have really kicked in as a classic comedy.</p><p>The well-trodden path of suddenly stepping into an unknown world — think Elf or Crocodile Dundee — can really work when written well.</p><p>But after a few pervy insults from strangers to Barbie, and <a href=#>Ken</a> discovering the “patriarchy” — a word so overused in <span id=1eb39cb2-dcd9-463e-b27a-64043151f5a5 class=suggested-link>the script</span> it will make you want to bite your fist — Barbie is soon running around the offices of Mattel toy company with its CEO, played by <a href=#>Will Ferrell</a>, and trying to juggle reversing sexism.</p><p>What follows is a hamster wheel of relentless identity crises, musical numbers, tears, tantrums, bland feminist speeches, questionable acting from the huge cast and Ken suddenly turning into a deranged ex-boyfriend.</p><p>The final “joke” is so eye-rollingly bad it left me grateful I always played with Sindy dolls.</p><p>Here, we look at why <a href=#>Barbie’s big-screen</a> world is less than perfect...</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Can’t-miss-it marketing</h2><p>WHETHER you’re excited about the Barbie movie or sick of it already, one thing is for certain, you won’t have been able to escape the hype.</p><p>The movie has a reported $100million (£77million) marketing budget, with a strategy that has been years in the making.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barbies-boyfriend-ken-couldn-t-828002196.jpg><p>Stars Margot and Ryan have been on a round-the-world charm offensive to promote it, complete with <a href=#>replica Barbie looks</a> for Margot to wear on the red carpet.</p><p>While the plot has, until now, been a closely guarded secret, pink billboards – which only contain the film’s release date – have appeared in cities around the world.</p><p>And there have been a number of stunts, from a pink Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu available to rent on Airbnb to Barbican Tube station in <a href=#>London</a> being renamed Barbiecan, that have guaranteed it press attention.</p><p>It has also inspired a Barbie-core fashion trend, with Valentino launching a Pink PP Collection and celebrities including <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> and the <a href=#>Duchess of Cambridge</a> embracing the pretty in pink wardrobe explosion.</p><p>Meanwhile, Barbie manufacturer Mattel has signed a host of lucrative licensing tie-ins, from shoes to clothing collections and even Barbie Xbox controllers.</p><p>But Barbie’s dominance is most apparent on social media, where a number of clips and memes have been shared feverishly.</p><p>The filmmakers also cleverly devised social media posters that users could personalise with themselves as the Barbie.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos</h2><p><a href=#>DUA LIPA</a> is one of the big-name cameos on Barbie but you have to keep your eyes peeled to not miss it.</p><p>She plays a Mermaid Barbie, replete with blue wig, and inexplicably has an American accent –odd, given producers are happy to let the narrator, <a href=#>Helen Mirren</a>, keep her English one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rob-brydon-attends-european-premiere-831491478.jpg><p>Former wrestling legend <a href=#>John Cena</a> emerges from the sea with golden locks as a Kenmaid.</p><p>Gavin and Stacey star Rob Brydon also appears for an excruciating micro-turn as Sugar Daddy Ken.</p><p>Even he admits it’s a short stint, saying: “When you go to see this amazing film please don’t blink.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Child-unfriendly</h2><p>PARENTS and Barbie fans across the land will be wondering whether this film is suitable for the little ones.</p><p>They may be a bit disappointed. With a 12A certificate, it is not generally suitable for under-12s, though an adult can take them to see it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/live-barbie-land-perfect-perfect-832546286.jpg><p>Certainly, many of the classic toys are represented – the dolls, the Dreamhouse and Barbie’s pink Corvette.</p><p>But the general “smash the patriarchy” tone of the film and talk of “genitals” is likely to baffle younger minds.</p><p>My Little Pony: The Movie, this ain’t.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Woke-up call</h2><p>OF course Barbie producers have taken a generous glug from the Goblet of Woke, especially since the doll has long faced accusations that it sets impossible standards for women.</p><p>Director Greta Gerwig sets out to turn that stereotype on its head, by giving <a href=#>Barbie a feminist makeover</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-hari-nef-attends-world-832568478.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/america-ferrera-attends-photocall-july-831537805.jpg><p>Not a bad aim, but the problem is the execution, which is about as subtle as the bright-pink palette that drenches this movie.</p><p>There’s a trans actress, Hari Nef, playing Doctor Barbie and more right-on feminist soap-box hectoring than is strictly necessary.</p><p>America Ferrera’s character hardly wastes a scene decrying “the patriarchy” with one rant that never seems to end.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with a message that champions women and their right to be ordinary, but the movie abandons the “show don’t tell” approach for relentless browbeating instead.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>It looks pink-credible</h2><p>THE jokes might fall flat and the plot may be confusing but there is no denying that this is one seriously good-looking film.</p><p>From the faithfully reproduced costumes to the plastic-fantastic Dreamhouse, it is a feast for the eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lmk110-j8677-231222-supplied-lmkmedia-832516755.jpg><p>Margot, who first appears on screen as a 10ft-high glamazon in a striped swimsuit and red lipstick, <a href=#>is in bombshell movie star</a> mode.</p><p>Then there is the pink. The set required so much pink paint during construction that it wiped out an entire company’s global supply.</p><p>Movie director Greta Gerwig said: “I wanted the pinks to be very bright and everything to be almost too much,” adding that she didn’t want to, “forget what made me love Barbie when I was a little girl”.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>In-your-face product placement</h2><p>NO surprise that a big <a href=#>Hollywood</a> film would be stacked with product placement but in Barbie it is so clunky it is like being whacked round the head with a brochure.</p><p>General Motors are all over it, with the Chevy Blazer electric vehicle hogging the screen so long you’d think you were watching a commercial for it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mage-released-warner-bros-pictures-832263933-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/live-barbie-land-perfect-perfect-832546206-1.jpg><p>But the real crime here is not the naked commercialism that Barbie’s car, a Chevy Corvette is also owned by GM, but the fact a lame car chase scene is shoehorned in for no other apparent reason than to show off the Chevy.</p><p><a href=#>Chanel</a> also gets a big moment, with one scene seeing Margot Robbie wearing heavily branded jewellery and a handbag.</p><p>And, of course, there’s lots of Mattel, which literally has a starring role.</p><p>It will be cashing in with a huge range of Barbie Movie merchandise, including a pink Corvette convertible at £135, and a range of dolls, including a plastic version of Issa Rae’s President Barbie, at £67 each.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Is it a musical or not?</h2><p>THE film has a few musical numbers, including a disco scene featuring a dance-music-by-numbers track called Dance The Night from Dua Lipa.</p><p>The soundtrack is produced by Mark Ronson and includes tracks by Tame Impala and <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aqua-pictured-nicki-minaj-ice-832567429-1.jpg><p>But if you’re hoping Barbie is a musical you’ll have to wait until near the end, when the action gets incredibly surreal and Ryan channels his inner La La Land for a big Ken number.</p><p>Best musical moment is The Indigo Girls’ Closer To Fine, played as the characters drive from Barbieland to the Real World and back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSFd3%2BRa21rZ56axG6uwKuZop1dm7atuYysn6ivXaiypL7Erapmq6WnvbO10qKloGWSp7a1ecKapJ6no2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
