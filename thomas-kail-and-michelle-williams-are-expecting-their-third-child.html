In a recent interview, Venom’s actor stated:</p><p>“It’s completely joyful. As the year’s pass, you begin to worry what they may or may not contain for you. It’s thrilling to realize that something you’ve wanted repeatedly is now accessible once again. That wonderful fortune has not gone unnoticed by myself or my family.”</p><p>Williams and Kail already have a son, Hart, born in 2020. Michelle also has a 16-year-old daughter named Matilda from her marriage to late actor Heath Ledger.</p><h2>All About Michelle Williams’ spouse</h2><p>Thomas Kail, who was born on January 30, 1978, is best known for directing Off-Broadway and Broadway performances of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musicals In The Heights and Hamilton.

She remarked that having a small kid helped her put the pandemic’s grim headlines into perspective. She stated:</p><p>“It reminded me that life continues on.” The world we brought a baby into is not the world we expected to bring a baby into, yet the infant has no idea. He feels the pure thrill of exploration as well as the joy of a caring household.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Thomas-Kail-3.jpg alt="Thomas Kail" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Williams feels that being a mother has strengthened her commitment to her career as an actor and the humanitarian issues she supports.&nbsp;The Shutter Island actress will next be seen in Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age movie The Fabelmans.
