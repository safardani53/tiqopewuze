The way @jamieleecurtis’ friend Debbie was there for her during the #Oscars nominations proves just that."</p><p>While many appreciated the segment, fans couldn't stop chiming in about how much they loved Hoda's outfit of the day.</p><p>One wrote: "love the pants and the sweater! gorgeous!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HODA KOTB">READ MORE ON HODA KOTB</h2><p>Another shared: "The lavender is your color Hoda. It looks beautiful on you."</p><p>More fans agreed that the sweater looked great on the host: "I am enjoying the fresh new outfits. I love you both but you tend to be a little too conservative in your clothes and Jenna you’re so young to wear dark clothes. I love you in this Jean outfit today and Hoda I love that purple on you and the leather pants!"</p><p>"Great color for Hoda," another fan commented.</p><h2>HODA UP!</h2><p>Meanwhile, Hoda hung out with Ted Lasso stars Jason Sudeikis and Brett Goldstein when they appeared on Monday's interview on the Today show.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>She then exhibited some strange behavior, which she <a href=#>blamed on the actors</a>.</p><p>The Today co-anchor and both actors stood extremely still and stared sternly at the camera in a teaser before their interview on Monday.</p><p>Jason,&nbsp;<a href=#>Hoda</a>,&nbsp;and Brett spaced themselves an equal distance apart in the studio and stood with their thumbs up.</p><p>The trio stared straight ahead in silence, before Hoda broke and burst out laughing.</p><p>She pointed to her guests and explained: "They're making me do this!</p><p>"I wanted to say some words but these guys are with me."</p><p>Hoda, 58, then revealed that she'd be chatting to Jason and Brett about their new Apple TV+ show, Shrinking.</p><h2>CHEEZ-WHIZZED</h2><p>Last week, Hoda shocked the Today crew when she blasted co-host Jenna with <a href=#>Cheez-Whiz</a>.</p><p>On Friday's show, also known as National Cheese Lover's Day, <a href=#>Hoda</a>, 58, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Jenna</a>, 41, stood with the show's culinary producer, Katie, to play Seize That Cheese!</p><p>The object of the game was to answer a cheese-related question correctly and whoever succeeded got to keep the cheese that was brought out for that round.</p><p>The player with the most cheese at the end of the game would win a prize.</p><p>After a few rounds, there was a tie.</p><p>Cheez Whiz was brought out as the last cheese.</p><p>The question was: "What is Chuck E. Cheese's middle name?"</p><p>After looking at the three options, Jenna answered correctly with "Entertainment."</p><p>When Jenna got the answer correct, Hoda picked up the spray cheese, took the cap off, and shook it.</p><p>"No, no, no!" Jenna screamed. "No, no, no!"</p><p>"No, you won, so yay!" Hoda said, as she aimed the bottle toward Jenna.</p><p>"That doesn't mean you spray me with Cheez Whiz," Jenna laughed, as she stuck her hands up.</p><p>Hoda put the can down and asked what Jenna won, which was a box of Ritz Crackers.</p><p>But, after she received her prize, Hoda picked it back up again.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>&nbsp;host sprayed some on her finger, but it wound up spraying and hitting Jenna and the floor.</p><p>The crew yelled and laughed off-camera and the women made disgusted faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/msemail_Web_capture_26-1-2023_144344_jpeg-JS791302589.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/msemail_Web_capture_26-1-2023_143921_scontent-gru2-2cdninstagramcomjpeg-JS791302196.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/EP-298108819_1288127941723185_1402906937741078332_njpg-JS752707497.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYmeFdICWaKuonJGueqm7w5pkpKekl3q0sdeyZKWdkam1pr6MqZinrKNir7C706xkppmbmry3sdFmp6GnpKR8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
